That’s where I come in—with strategy, structure, and the FROST Framework. I’m the co-founder of yorCMO, the first decentralized leadership franchise for fractional CMOs. And now, I’m scaling FractionalPros.com, a platform that connects SMBs with vetted fractional leaders—and helps those leaders find visibility, leads, and community through niche-driven peer pods. I believe in decentralized teams, strategic clarity, and the idea that every expert deserves a business model that works for them, not just because of them. I’ve had a non-linear career and life. I’ve: - Started a lawn care service in high school and sold the business before college - Studied and worked in chemical engineering - Founded 4 companies: from mortgage financing to media to data haptics tech - Published and written a book on media habits - Taught Entrepreneurship to university students - Created a documentary film on the seasons of entrepreneurship - Launched a community for fractional pros I spent years attempting to reconcile my wildly diverse experiences, let alone trying to explain them to those around me. Eventually, I realized that my decentralized nature was an asset: I could help other entrepreneurs engineer non-traditional, weird, unexpected and creative ideas into their businesses.

Since 2016, we’ve built a growing team of fractional CMOs, exclusively limited to those with decades of experience and proven leadership in various industries. As part of the yorCMO proven process, your CMO becomes a fiduciary partner, building your customized strategy and executing it in a way that drives up sales, without wasting any more of your time or money. But our work could never be possible by simply remaining in the “outsider” role that is so common among marketing consultants, agencies, and vendors. That’s why when you partner with us, we’re more than a consultant. We’re on your team‒ but for a fraction of the cost of adding on another full-time employee. Our results-driven fractional CMO model is designed to allow us to integrate with your existing team so that you get the customized solutions, C-Level expertise, and proven process you need. It’s a model designed around our belief that “your success is our success,” and we are uncommonly committed to your success.

    "summary": "My journey's been quite a ride: from an Army brat to Military Police, then a police officer, paramedic, Navy spouse, and a business owner for 30 years. All those experiences gave me a unique lens for navigating life's big challenges. And my military dad? He taught me that your word is everything, period. That's always been my North Star. Then came the moment that changed everything. After my husband, Jim, passed away, I found myself in a really vulnerable spot, something I never expected despite my business success. That feeling was a huge wake-up call. I just refused to let anyone else go through that, so I dug in and mastered how to build lasting stability and well-being. My friends say I'm stubborn about everything, and hey, they're not wrong! For over 20 years, I've had the incredible privilege of helping hundreds of families and thousands of folks become their most resilient selves. My passion is empowering the people who truly keep our country going—veterans, folks in rural America, farmers, truckers, and entrepreneurs. I love taking complicated stuff and making it simple, helping people really step into their power. My approach is pretty straightforward: think strategically, make smart choices, and use what you've got effectively. My biggest tip? Consistent, focused effort really does pay off big time in the long run. With six generations of military service in my family, helping those who've served is deeply personal for me. And living out here in rural America, I'm constantly working to help our communities find their footing and build a strong future, generation after generation. You know that saying, \"you are who you spend time with\"? That totally changed how I connect with people. I love bringing clients, experts, and executives together because I really get what makes them tick—their challenges, their dreams, all of it. When I'm not busy helping people create brighter futures, you'll find me on my farm, training horses and dogs. Oh, and get this: at 60, I'm on zero meds and can deadlift almost 300 pounds! It just goes to show you that the same rules apply whether you're building a strong life or a strong body: ditch what doesn't serve you, stay consistent, and nail the basics. That... is the new art of living.",
