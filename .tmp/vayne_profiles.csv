For any service provider, there is no question on whether or not you will run out of bandwidth and plateau. If you are not one of the very few who can set new goals and change your limiting relationships, habits and support structure, breaking out of this will be difficult. This requires coaching. Business Owners are limited on growth by the talent, capabilities and behaviors of their salespeople. Too many business owners hire salespeople based on their resume, recognizable personality traits and how well they interview. They fire them based on suitability. The recruiting process does not allow them to get into the things that are more important like are they motivated enough, can they exhibit the right behaviors in your selling environment and do they have the right soft skills to be successful. They are not on-boarded properly, working well defined markets, have a detailed prospecting plan and tracking the right things to know they will be successful and how to improve. As a result, they spend too much time prospecting and not enough time in meetings closing business. Any sales team will have 20% doing well, 10% struggling and the other 70% mediocre. No one hires salespeople expecting mediocrity. We take the people with potential from average to top producer with training and coaching. You can hire anyone to train your sales staff, but repetition is only one leg of the stool. They need coaching or ordinarily the behaviors don't change and the full potential is not realized.

What if I told you that a tiny shift in thinking could have a massive impact on your future - - would you want to grow more? A single profound insight could help you radically grow your business, launch a career or improve a relationship. Most businesses stagnate after just a few years of growth. Why is that? The main problem is that instead of relentlessly focusing on what is important most leaders focus on everything else. This is called the ""tyranny of the urgent."" We see this almost every day. When this happens the machinery of the organization begins to get clogged up and often times outdated. This is when creativity lags and the cutting edge becomes dull. Our goal is to help leaders and their teams fine-tune and supercharge their organizational performance. Just like... - David who was exhausted and ready to sell his business. Now enjoying the greatest profits and time freedom he's ever had. - Corey who runs a car wash chain and doubled in size from 6 to 13 sites while also building his leadership team - Dr. Saeed who was losing multiple 6 figures a year on process inefficiencies in his spine clinic. Now reaping much higher profits by taking care of his clients and referral partners better - Heather rapidly grew her family law firm, was able to move into a much nicer office building and spend more time with her family. - Jordan was able to greatly reduce their turnover, empower their departmental leads which has led to 3 straight years of 7 figure growth.
