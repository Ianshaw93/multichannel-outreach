The first step can include the review of search requests, followed by a response linking to a media file containing an advertisement. The second step can be a delivery process. The advertising cannot be considered spam as the user can be redirected towards information that can directly correlate to the users search. The advertising can be done with the full cooperation and volition of the media company or companies involved. The advertisers' contract with the media companies can allow for payment and the media companies can then expose their product to potential buyers. The third step can be contacting an advertising server any time that media file is played. In this third step it can be determined what the optimal advertisement for this media file is.",

    "about": "Hey, I'm Erik! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI build automated outbound systems that combine Email + LinkedIn to get consistent meetings.\n\nMy background isn't just sales\u2014it's system architecture.\n\nHonestly, I think most companies get outbound completely wrong. They treat it as a brute-force activity. They hire more SDRs, send more generic spam, and hope something sticks. But all that does is burn through your TAM and annoy potential buyers.\n\nI treat outbound as an engineering problem.\n\nBy combining AI, Clay, and data orchestration, I build systems that generate revenue on autopilot without the manual grind.\n\nBut here's the reality: not every company needs the same level of complexity.\n\nIf you're a Founder looking for speed, you need execution.\nIf you're a Sales Leader at a mid-market firm, you need infrastructure.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 CHOOSE YOUR PATH\n\nFOR SMBs & FOUNDERS: Lumos (lumosco.ai)\n\nIf you need leads yesterday, you don't have time to master complex tools or manage an expensive team. You just need a partner to handle the execution so you can focus on taking the meetings.\n\n\u2022 Done-for-you LinkedIn outreach starting at $297/mo.\n\u2022 We handle the heavy lifting: list building, copywriting, and campaign management.\n\u2022 You get a consistent stream of leads delivered to your inbox while you focus on closing deals.\n\nFOR MID-MARKET & ENTERPRISE: AGENTIC (heyagentic.ai)\nCustom GTM Engineering & Clay Workflows\n\nIf your sales team is established but your data is messy and workflows are manual, you need a GTM Engineer to architect a system that fits your tech stack.\n\n\u2022 Fractional GTM Engineering and high-complexity automation.\n\u2022 I'll build custom Clay tables, waterfall data enrichment, programmatic no-code automation, AI-agent research, and CRM integrations.\n\u2022 You get a fully autonomous prospecting machine that targets your ICP with hyper-personalized relevance at scale.\n\nCLIENT RESULTS\n\nRegardless of the path, my philosophy is the same. It's about results (not busy work):\n\n\u2705 Enterprise CRM Platform: Generated 40+ qualified meetings/mo using AI-powered personalization.\n\u2705 Project Management SaaS: Cut 15+ hours of manual prospecting/week while maintaining 15%+ reply rates.\n\u2705 Global HR Platform: Delivered 22 sales meetings in Week 1 via scalable infrastructure.\n\nREADY TO BUILD YOUR PIPELINE?\n\nOption A: \"I need affordable, consistent leads right now.\" (Lumos)\nWeb: lumosco.ai\nEmail: erik@lumosco.ai\n\nOption B: \"I need custom engineering & Clay automation.\" (Agentic)\nBook a Strategy Call: https://tidycal.com/heyagentic/30-minutes\nEmail: erik@heyagentic.ai",

You look busy, but you\u2019re burning ad spend on low-value calls while real revenue slips through the cracks.Most advisors say \u201canswer faster,\u201d buy a call centre, or pour more money into ads. That fills your board \u2014 but your database still becomes a graveyard of missed opportunities.The real problem isn\u2019t a lack of leads \u2014 it\u2019s weak, inconsistent follow-up on the leads you already paid for. Instead of chasing more leads, I start by reactivating the ones sitting in your ServiceTitan (or Housecall Pro). If you don\u2019t fix your follow-up system first, nothing else actually plugs the holes in your sales process.In well-run HVAC reactivation programs, 5\u201315% of old leads typically book \u2014 and 20\u201340% of those estimates become full system replacements, often worth $12k\u2013$20k each. That\u2019s why I prove replacement revenue in your database first, before you spend another dollar on ads.Here\u2019s how it works:\u2192 First, we test about 500 old ServiceTitan (or Housecall Pro) leads to prove results.\u2192 Then, we scale reactivation across your database and optimize bookings.\u2192 Finally, we add fast follow-up on your newest leads.Most companies see booked estimates within 30\u201390 days.If you\u2019re a ServiceTitan HVAC owner in a hot state struggling with wasted ad spend on untouched leads, DM me REACTIVATE and I\u2019ll run a free small-sample test on your database to get you quick wins.",

    "about": "I've spent 25+ years building and running global recruiting organizations\u2014the kind that scale across time zones, navigate difficult stakeholders, and deliver when the pressure's on.I'm not just a strategist who delegates recruiting to a team. I still get my hands dirty with executive searches, close senior candidates who have multiple offers, and have those uncomfortable conversations with hiring managers when their expectations don't match reality.What I bring to the table:GLOBAL TA LEADERSHIPI've led recruiting teams of 100+ across North America, LATAM, EMEA, and India. I know what it takes to manage recruiters in different regions, deal with cultural differences, and keep everyone aligned when priorities shift. I've opened delivery centers, managed cross-border hiring compliance, and built regional recruiting teams from scratch.WORKING WITH DIFFICULT STAKEHOLDERSLet's be honest\u2014not every executive is easy to work with. I've partnered with demanding Sales VPs, impatient Delivery leaders, and founders who want to hire someone yesterday for half the market rate. I've learned how to manage up, push back respectfully when timelines are unrealistic, and maintain trust even when I have to deliver bad news.HANDS-ON EXECUTIVE RECRUITINGI don't just oversee recruiting\u2014I personally run searches for C-level roles, practice leaders, and sales executives. I source passive candidates, build relationships over time, and close deals when candidates are weighing multiple offers. I understand the nuances of recruiting for client-facing roles in consulting and financial services.BUILDING RECRUITING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SCALESI've implemented ATS systems globally (Greenhouse expert, ATLAS for recruiting &amp; sales integration, currently evaluating Ashby), created workforce planning models tied to sales pipelines, and built data-driven hiring processes that actually improve decision-making. I stay current with AI-powered sourcing tools (Juicebox, GEM, Pin, Wrangle, Clay) and know how to integrate them into workflows that recruiters will actually use\u2014not just pile on more technology. I've also managed agency partnerships, vendor relationships, and compliance across multiple jurisdictions.Industries: Financial Services, Capital Markets IT, Consulting, IT Services, TechnologySpecialties: Executive recruiting, sales &amp; client-facing roles, global team leadership, stakeholder management, delivery center buildouts, data-driven TA strategy",

    "about": "I focus on building a culture of quality that goes beyond compliance. Non-compliance carries real costs \u2014 risks to reputation, wasted time fixing bugs, and missed opportunities for growth. By shifting the mindset toward pride in delivery and customer trust, I help teams unlock more time for innovation and capability-building.\n\nI put this into practice through training, audits, and cross-team workshops that break down silos and build shared accountability. This extends to interactions with customers working to understand their challenges \u2013 known and unknown, to ensure solutions truly meet their needs. Documenting processes and driving improvement actions ensure quality becomes part of how teams work, not an afterthought. The result: stronger collaboration, higher efficiency, and consistently better outcomes.\n\nAt the heart of my approach is people. In every role, my goal has been to help others succeed \u2014 as engineers, as professionals, and as customers. I believe products should enable people to do their jobs effectively and with minimal pain, creating a positive contribution to their success rather than just another task.",

        "description": "I first came upon the name Barry Flanagan in the late 90s. He was a Citrix SE and one of the few in the world sharing and teaching the virtues and tech of End-User Computing technologies. When I joined Citrix in 2001, he was one of the people I was so excited and nervous to meet. Since that day, Barry has been a true friend, honest, helpful, and kind. He has taught me more about life than tech/business, yet he taught me so much about the latter. Barry has always been at the top of my hero list. A wonderful man. A truly remarkable human. \n\nSince those early days, I have enjoyed watching him grow beyond being SEs together, never losing his humanity. Wherever he has gone, success follows. From those days at Citrix to working together at ControlUp, Barry has shown true leadership. Barry also played a critical role in ControlUp's rapid rise. \n\nHowever, Barry is more than just kind and helpful to me. He takes this time with everyone. Many people would say the same as I do. Barry's wake through our industry is untold. He is humble. I will sure sing his praises, as so many of us do. \n\nBarry humbles me. I don't have the proper words to express what I think of him and how he has affected my life. I've met many people over my 25 years in this industry. Barry is the one I have the most respect for, as he continues to earn it and be the best person I have met in this industry. There is nobody I can recommend more than Barry Flanngan. He is my HERO.",

Barry's strategic vision and leadership were instrumental in propelling our Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in these regions by an astonishing 17X over five years\u2014a testament to his ability to drive growth and navigate the complexities of international markets.\n\nUnder Barry's stewardship, the sales team expanded from a modest group of seven to a formidable force of 40 dedicated professionals. His commitment to fostering a culture of excellence and continuous improvement was evident in the way he maintained a remarkably low churn rate and significantly outperforming the industry average. This achievement alone speaks volumes about Barry's understanding of customer needs and his ability to build lasting relationships.\n\nBarry's was a great business partner. His strategic initiatives, such as the implementation of the MEDDIC Sales Qualification process across the Americas Sales team, set new standards for efficiency and effectiveness in our sales operations. His innovative \"Pain Prompter\" tool helped change our approach to pain discovery and enabled our team to better identify and address customer challenges. \n\nBarry is a visionary leader whose contributions have left an indelible mark on ControlUp and me. His blend of strategic foresight, operational excellence, and dedication to team development made him an invaluable business partner. I wholeheartedly recommend Barry for any leadership role in sales and business development, confident that he will bring the same level of commitment, innovation, and success to his future endeavors.\n\nI truly look forward to the opportunity to work with him again.",

We started on the same day and instantly began a productive working relationship focused on achieving key wins for the company and scaling processes to increase our odds of closing deals.\n\nBarry was a fantastic sounding board and mentor for any stage in the sales process and was keen on propping up his sales team to succeed. His lack of micromanagement and extensive rope to get deals done yielded excellent results for our team, and I was always pleasantly surprised on the tact and effectiveness of his leadership style.\n\nOn a last note, it\u2019s always worth noting a leader who has patience when things don\u2019t turn out as planned. Throughout the sales cycle, there are plenty of ups with some losses along the way, and I always admired Barry\u2019s ability to see through the short term troughs. His constant support and willingness to see eye-to-eye is a rare managerial trait and I\u2019m honored to have had the opportunity to work with him on a 1:1 level.\n\nIn conclusion, Barry is an excellent sales manager and leader, and I look forward to an opportunity to collaborate again.

Barry's discerning eye for emerging technologies, such as Outreach.io, Gong.io, Zoominfo, and Vidyard, significantly contributed to this exponential growth by enhancing our operational efficiency and outreach effectiveness. Barry's aptitude for analyzing the company's analytics has unquestionably proven to be invaluable.\n\nI also had the privilege of continuing to work closely with Barry when I transitioned to the role of Commercial Account Executive.

Barry is unlike most managers I've ever had as he is not afraid to take risks and try new things to improve the day-to-day life and performance of his sales team. He is data driven and will always allow you to try new initiatives as long as you A/B test and put together a compelling story for why you believe an idea will benefit the team. \n\nAdditionally, Barry isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and actually do the day to day work to research and try everything on his own before rolling out any new initiatives to his team.\n\nBarry is incredibly technical which I believe comes from his time as a Sales Engineer. This is beneficial to his ability to lead a sales organization because he understands that to win a deal you need to win on the technical and business side and how both sides play a critical role in advancing or losing a deal.\n",

His leadership in building a targeted Product-Led Growth strategy, aligned with an early adopter sales motion across North America and EMEA, resulted in a remarkable 62% growth in High Intent Leads and an impressive 44% year-over-year growth in sales demo meetings. These achievements underscore Alex's keen strategic insights and ability to execute initiatives that drive tangible business outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, Alex played a pivotal role in building ControlUp's brand identity. Through innovative campaigns and targeted analyst relations, he successfully positioned the company within the burgeoning DEX category, enhancing our market presence and differentiation.\n\nAlex's proficiency in aligning go-to-market strategies with industry leaders such as Citrix, VMWare, and Microsoft was excellent. His focus on product alignment and execution of an Account-Based Marketing strategy facilitated joint account planning efforts, resulting in accelerated sales growth.\n\nIn summary, Alex Rublowsky is a highly talented and results-driven professional who possesses a combination of strategic vision, analytical acumen, determination and a great work ethic.

    "about": "I work with fund managers at two pivotal moments:\nwhen they are launching a new fund, or when they are realizing their current administrator is no longer built for where they\u2019re going.\n\nI\u2019ve spent over 20 years in fund administration and fund operations, working across hedge funds, private equity, credit, real estate, and \u2014 since 2015 \u2014 digital asset and blockchain-based fund structures.\n\nI currently serve as Managing Director, USA at The Ascent Group, a global fund administrator founded in 2019 that grew organically across 18+ jurisdictions before opening its U.S. office in 2023. Over one-third of Ascent\u2019s client base operates in crypto, blockchain, and digital assets, including more than 30 tokenized fund structures globally.\n\nAscent is now part of KFin Technologies, a global fintech firm that has been deliberately building an agentic fund operations platform. This acquisition reflects a different model than traditional, roll-up driven administrators \u2014 one focused on technology integration, unified data, and systems-led operations, rather than preserving fragmented legacy stacks.\n\nPrior to Ascent, I was an executive at DwellFi, an AI-driven fintech applying AI and blockchain to real fund operations. Our work went beyond tokenizing assets for representation or proxy voting \u2014 we focused on tokenizing fund and investor data itself: NAV packages, GP/LP data, capital activity, and investor workflows.\n\nThat approach enables automation of capital calls, distributions, and waterfall calculations \u2014 and shaped my belief that the future of fund administration is systems-led, not headcount-led.\n\nI believe fund administration should feel quiet, resilient, and confidence-building \u2014 especially as funds scale, innovate, or come under increased regulatory and investor scrutiny.\n\nIf you\u2019re launching a fund, evaluating an administrator change, or navigating complexity around digital assets or tokenization, I\u2019m always happy to compare notes.",

Clients were fed up of highly reactive recruiters only placing job adverts and making a few proactive calls to try and fill their roles and their high fees. Moreover they were fed up of recruiters wanting every company as a client meaning that many talent pools were now off limits given inherent conflicts of interests. \n \nTo solve this problem we commissioned a team of researchers to map and build a database of all C-suite/key person risk roles across every international mining/engineering company. This database was hand built through powerful search algorithms that made large scale recruitment systems like ADAPT look clunky and outdated. This game was all about intelligence and speed. This unique database mapped entire organizations and held detailed maps and information meaning that we could access and headhunt them quickly for our clients. \n \nOnce the database was built we would offer our services to some 10 companies only who would employ us and pay us monthly on a 3 year contract to be their outsourced talent acquisition team and bring to them the org charts and candidates from their competitors at an affordable price within a record turnaround time. We believed in an ideal fusion of research, mapping, headhunting and the emerging use of social media to source,acquire and retain the best talent for our clients. HRM drew a line in the sand and was a gun for hire for select companies in the \"war for talent\".  \n \nAccomplishments \n \nWe managed to create a world first recruitment platform and model for select clients to massively improve not only their talent acquisition goals but to ensure post-placement fall out rarely happened thanks to our investment and meticulous psychological profiling and needs analysis work done at the front, middle and back end of assignments.",

        "jobDescription": "Responsibilities \n\nIn my time at RHI, I spent 15 months in London before launching the Brisbane Australia office with Richard Dunks in late 2005. I recruited and placed staff to executive level accounting and finance professionals. I built the permanent staffing division from scratch and built a highly successful team of consultants whilst achieving my personal placement/billing goals to lead from the front. In my first full year in 2006 I became the number 1 producer in Australasia from a cold desk and then achieved my ultimate individual goal in 2007 of becoming the Worldwide No 1 recruiter for RHI. This was a feat never achieved outside of the USA nor with responsibility for a divisional team in a cold market. This was the goal I had set myself before moving on to launch my own companies shortly after in 2008. During my tenure I became a trusted advisor to many candidates and clients and seeded my ideals for success around targeting a \"hidden market\" of highly sought after passive job seekers. My future companies were successful as they were built around this ethos and other innovative differentiating ideas built around the application of neuroscience, NLP and behavioral/motivational psychology and it's application in the career space. \n \nAccomplishments \n\nBecame the number 1 producer in Australasia with a cold desk billing $875,000 and in a start up in 2006. \nBecame the number 1 producer in the WORLD the following year in 2007 billing $1,250,000 whilst also building a top performing team of 5 with total billings of $3,100,000",
