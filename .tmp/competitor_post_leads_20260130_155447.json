        "postText": "By Coach MJ Tolan You\u2019ve spent a career making high-stakes decisions, leading teams, navigating crises, mentoring others, and bringing visions to life. What if all of that was more than just a professional legacy? What if it was the foundation for your next chapter\u2014as a published author, keynote speaker, and respected thought leader? Many executives underestimate the transformative potential of their own lived experiences. The late nights, the make-or-break moments, the cultural shifts you led\u2014these aren\u2019t just career milestones. They\u2019re stories with the power to teach, inspire, and move others. What you\u2019ve learned the hard way, others are desperate to understand. Your journey holds insights that no textbook or MBA program can replicate. And when those insights are shaped into a compelling message, they become legacy assets\u2014a book, a platform, and a voice that can ripple across industries, stages, and generations. But here\u2019s the truth: writing a book and stepping into thought leadership isn\u2019t just about typing up war stories or reliving boardroom battles. It requires clarity, structure, narrative, and positioning. This is where a seasoned coach becomes not just helpful\u2014but essential. A coach helps you zoom out and spot the transformational arc in your story. They ask the deeper questions: What\u2019s the defining message that ties your career together? Who needs to hear this now? What\u2019s the problem you solve? What\u2019s the shift in thinking only you can provoke? Through powerful frameworks and deep listening, a coach extracts the gold from your journey and helps refine it into a signature message\u2014one that can anchor a book, a keynote, and even a movement. Then there\u2019s the execution: shaping your manuscript, building your storytelling voice, organizing your IP, and preparing you for your public debut\u2014not just on the page, but on stage. A coach is your strategic partner in defining your author brand, designing your book\u2019s structure, overcoming writing resistance, and aligning your story with your future goals. They help you write with both authenticity and audience clarity\u2014so your book doesn\u2019t just land, it resonates. And the benefits? They go far beyond publishing. A book becomes your calling card, your differentiator, your door-opener. It cements your credibility in a noisy marketplace and positions you as the authority you already are. As a speaker, it gives you substance, context, and proof. It helps potential clients, investors, boards, and media understand your value\u2014because your story is no longer confined to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It lives in a narrative that moves people to act. If you\u2019ve ever felt that your journey was meant for more than just a closing chapter in your career, now is the time to act. The world doesn\u2019t need more noise. It needs wisdom. And no one else has walked your exact path. Let a coach help you illuminate it. Let your story become your greatest legacy. And let that legacy become your launchpad. FROM EXECUTIVE TO AUTHOR TO KEYNOTE STAGE A Message from Coach M J Tolan | The Mission: I'M Possible What if the life you've already lived is the message the world is waiting to hear? \ud83c\udfa4 Phil Knight (Nike) wrote Shoe Dog and became a storytelling icon. \ud83c\udfa4 Mel Robbins shared her personal breakthrough and launched a global movement with The 5 Second Rule. \ud83c\udfa4 Marc Randolph (Netflix co-founder) turned his rollercoaster startup tale into a best-selling book \u2014 and now commands packed keynote stages worldwide. \ud83c\udfa4 Steve Pemberton rose from adversity to the C-suite and shared it all in A Chance in the World, becoming a beacon for inclusive leadership. Each of them transformed their life experiences into a book \u2014 and their book into a brand. And they all started with one bold step: \ud83d\udfe0 They told their story. \ud83d\udfe0 They packaged their insight. \ud83d\udfe0 They owned the mic. So, here\u2019s the question... What story are YOU sitting on? The one that taught you resilience. The one that shaped your leadership. The one that could change someone else\u2019s path.

Instantly he impressed me as someone who brought a unique and artistic perspective to the venture. Within a very short time, I recognized why the organizers had entrusted Flo to be the grandmaster spokesperson for the entire 1,000 delegate congress. True to form on the day of the conference he displayed his cool and calm manner while consciously and with stagecraft elegance pulled the audience attention and kept them spelbound with his polished speaking personality and natural charisma.\nFlo proved to be one of the best Event Host/ MC  presenters I had ever had the pleasure of working with, and that's counting over 100 major events over 10 years globally. If you have a conference that requires perfect execution, a TV personality type spokesperson to run it as more than just an MC, who thinks like a producer and entertains your audience while handling your speaker line up, conference breaks, cadence of the event, you will be more than rewarded by the compliments you will receive by having this total professional in your corner.

    "about": "I am the founder and interior designer of xomos studio.  I believe that design is a romantic language of its own kind.  A language that creates a dialogue by shaping interiors through atmospheres that elevate the way people live and experience space. \n\nAs a designer, my mission is to curate environments that go beyond aesthetics, where materiality, art, and atmosphere merge to evoke emotion and memory. Each project is an act of artistic transformation approached with the same sensitivity and intention as an artist before their canvas.\n\nMy studies abroad and traveling to different countries shape my inspirations and how I envision xomos studio as a design and lifestyle atelier that celebrates collaboration by uniting artisans, trades, and clients through shared respect and creative intent. Together, we craft timeless spaces that inspire and endure.\n\nI aspire to contribute to a larger collective that redefines how conscious design influences the way we live. Reimagining ideas and guiding them to fruition across diverse project types is where my creativity flourishes. Through intentional communication and the refinement of detail, I aim to shape experiences that feel both personal and elevated.\n\nDesign, to me, is not just what you see, it\u2019s what you feel.",

These strategies consistently delivered top performers for complex, high-demand roles.\n\u26a1 I partnered directly with executives and hiring managers to understand business priorities, shaping sourcing campaigns that matched not only skills but cultural fit.\n\u26a1 I led and mentored sourcing teams, training them to move from transactional outreach to relationship-driven engagement that built trust with candidates from the first touchpoint.\n\u26a1 I drove the use of market intelligence and talent mapping, transforming sourcing from guesswork into a strategic advantage \u2014 giving leadership real-time insights into talent availability, competition, and demand.\n\u26a1 I optimized our CRM and sourcing technologies, implementing best practices that streamlined workflows and improved candidate experience.\n\nThis role reinforced my belief that sourcing isn\u2019t about chasing candidates \u2014 it\u2019s about building ecosystems of talent, aligning sourcing with business strategy, and creating meaningful conversations that turn passive talent into future leaders.\n\nAs Sourcing Director, my focus was simple: anticipate hiring needs before they became pain points, empower teams with the right tools and strategies, and ensure that organizations never had to choose between speed, quality, and culture fit.",

When I did, I had a much greater understanding of what made him tick.  \nHe\u2019s passionate motivated in his values for Leadership, Individualism (Authenticity), & Economic, ROI Oriented in action.  He\u2019s less interested in balance or harmony in life, with the bottom line/results  being most important.\n \nHis strengths include: \n\u2022 Handling objections, questions, & pressure with poise & confidence.\n\u2022 Very much at ease in making presentations to large or small groups.\n\u2022 Scores like those known to be 'movers & shakers' in the workplace.\n\u2022 Potential to be an engaging presenter.\n\u2022 A self-starter & active agent in all he does.\n\u2022 Understands people very well, & uses that understanding to lead, persuade, & motivate.\n\u2022 Able to delegate responsibility to others in an enthusiastic & personable way.\n\u2022 An excellent team-player, very effective at training or developing others.\n\nIn his work, his ideal Job Climate & activities include:\n\u2022 Building a network of people & contacts with groups.\n\u2022 Activities to get & maintain the attention of others.\n\u2022 A non-hostile working environment.\n\u2022 A democratic supervisor & work environment.\n\u2022 Activities with many opportunities for interaction with people.\n\u2022 Freedom from routine work.\n\u2022 Public recognition for accomplishments.\n\u2022 Variety in the work tasks & multiple projects.\n\nBased on his style preferences, count on him to be adventuresome in trying new ideas and innovations.  He\u2019s open to new approaches and takes an inquisitive and open attitude toward change.  He is very enthusiastic in working with others, & gregarious & outgoing with most everyone you meet.  No one is a stranger to him!  \n\nHe\u2019s also able to develop a variety of strategies and procedures as situations demand.  Like a Master Chef, he\u2019s always cooking, with varied activities, never a dull moment.   He possesses a high interest level in working with others, & makes friends easily with his personal & friendly approach.  \n\nIt was a great pleasure to work with him, & learn all of this & more!  I highly recommend him for any great leadership opportunity that aligns with his passions & values, as he will be successful for the long haul, if he\u2019s allowed to do what he does best.\n\nPlease contact me with any questions about Biaggio, I\u2019d be happy to back up everything I\u2019ve documented about him using validated tools, & our time together.\n\nSincerely,\nScott Hulderson",

I cannot stress enough how tirelessly he works to build team cohesiveness and for every member of the team to reach their goals, I wanted to get traffic at the time on LinkedIn and he was always showing support and suggesting ways I can be a more effective and become engaging communicator and mentor and provided his own personal examples, his own experiences what worked and what did not work for him.

He was considerate towards my feelings and proceeded with a very professional and amicable phone interview. \r\nMr. Triassi's phone interview lasted approximately 20 minutes in which during that time, he provided clear directives on the company policies. Mr. Triassi reassured me that Deloitte is a very good company and his positive attitude and professionalism eased my worries. \r\nThank you Mr. Triassi for a job well done!!! \r\nI'm sure all future candidates interviewed by him will feel optimistic and positive after speaking with him as I did.

Its about understanding human behavior. Whether its B2B or B2C, I believe that if you tell the right story to the right people, revenue follows naturally.\n\n\u2937 What I bring to the table:\n\u2705 Real Growth: I dont guess. I use data to drive consistent 20%+ YoY revenue growth for our partners.\n\n\u2705 The Full Stack: From designing the creatives to running the Google & Meta ads, and nailing the email strategy, I handle the ecosystem.\n\n\u2705 Finding Buyers: I specialize in hunting down leads and converting them into loyal customers.\n\nI treat every brand I work with like its my own business.

    "about": "I\u2019m a Federal Acquisition Specialist with 17+ years supporting complex federal programs, including TS/SCI environments, and more than $8B in lifecycle efforts spanning acquisition planning, execution, and follow-on awards.Throughout my career, I\u2019ve worked across the full contract lifecycle \u2014 from early acquisition strategy through delivery execution \u2014 and have seen firsthand why some teams consistently earn strong CPARS ratings while others struggle to replicate success. The difference is rarely talent or effort. It\u2019s how internal processes are structured, standardized, and reinforced as programs scale.My expertise centers on translating acquisition requirements into clear, repeatable internal processes so expectations are understood, execution is consistent, and performance is easy for the Government to evaluate and document. When this is done well, strong CPARS outcomes become the norm \u2014 and follow-on awards are a natural extension of performance, not a scramble.I\u2019m not pursuing individual contributor roles. When organizations reach out, it\u2019s typically because they want senior-level acquisition judgment embedded into how their teams operate, rather than tied to a single person.Cradle2Contract is where I codify this experience into reusable capability for organizations. It provides standardized acquisition and business development tools \u2014 including RFI and Sources Sought response generators, process frameworks, and execution guidance \u2014 designed to help teams consistently translate strong performance into competitive positioning for future awards.I highly encourage anyone or companies interested in my services to check out the associated company profile page for more information. It contains tons of free content and business development tools specifically created to help professionals and companies alike stand-out to their customers and lock in more awards.",

His sales instincts are phenomenal but what sets him apart from other sales leaders is his general business acumen. He thinks about the problem and the product. He\u2019s not afraid to try anything new, even coding prototypes to prove that his solutions are so simple a sales guy can do it. He\u2019s an effective leader and his teams have always responded well to him and delivered for him. Within the leadership teams he served, he was open and honest and wasn\u2019t afraid to speak truth to power. Davide has unparalleled energy and achieves more per day than anyone I\u2019ve ever encountered. I would not hesitate to work with Davide again and would recommend him as a sales and business development leader in any organization. ",

He (pro-)actively calls upon his team to advise him on the best way to move forward, then weighs in all criteria, and decides on next steps. He understands the importance of communication, and I believe he is well versed in the art of it.\n\nI furthermore enjoy drinking a beer and having a chat with him.

My work sits at the intersection of AI and EI, teaching leaders how to stay relevant, resilient, and real \u2014 when everything else is being rewritten by algorithms.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udd39 MY PHILOSOPHY:\nAI doesn\u2019t replace leaders \u2014 it reveals which ones were replaceable. The future belongs to those who lead with Human Intelligence (HI) \u2014 the ability to align IQ, EQ, and AQ to create impact that technology can\u2019t. I help leaders and organizations unlock what I call The Human Intelligence Advantage\u2122 \u2014 a set of frameworks, mindsets, and tools that future-proof leadership in the AI age.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 WHAT I DO:\nAs the CEO and Founder of JOSHUA MILLER Executive Coaching, I help leaders elevate performance, deepen emotional intelligence, and lead transformation at scale. My work appears across LinkedIn Learning, TEDx, Forbes, and global stages where the conversation on leadership and AI is being redefined.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 WHAT I BELIEVE: \nThe leaders who thrive in this decade will use technology as a tool \u2014 not a crutch. Because no algorithm replaces awareness. If you\u2019re a leader ready to upgrade your mindset, modernize your leadership, and build impact that outlasts any AI \u2014 let\u2019s connect.\n\n\n\u260e Book Your Coaching Discovery Call Today\u00a0\u27a4 https://lnkd.in/eKi5cCce\n\n\n\n*Certified in SCARF, EQ 2.0, MBTI, DISC, 6Seconds EI Assessment, Enneagram, DDI, Korn Ferry, and StrengthsFinder frameworks to support data-driven leadership coaching.",

It works through patterns, probabilities, and past data. When leaders don\u2019t understand that, they don\u2019t just misread the technology\u2014they misread their people. Judgment gets mislabeled as resistance. Speed gets confused with competence.\n\nThe research is already signaling this tension.\n\nA 2025 Scientific Reports study found that strong AI literacy combined with regular tool use improves problem-solving and computational thinking. But a peer-reviewed study in HFES - Human Factors and Ergonomics Society  shows the flip side: when leaders over-rely on AI advice, automation bias increases and independent judgment declines.\n\n\u27a4 That\u2019s the gap leaders must close.\n\nIf you lead people, AI literacy is now part of your job description\u2014not to become technical, but to lead with discernment.\n\nI recommend the following:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Ask yourself: Could I explain, in plain language, how AI influences decisions and workloads on my team? If not, spend 30 minutes mapping where AI informs\u2014or silently shapes\u2014choices today.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 In leadership development, practice pausing before acting on AI recommendations by asking, \u201cWhat might this model be missing?\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udd39 In talent reviews, reward leaders who challenge AI outputs and strengthen team judgment\u2014not just those who adopt tools fastest.\n\nLeadership credibility used to rest on business acumen alone.\nNow it includes understanding the tools shaping how work actually happens.\n\nIn the AI era, tools aren\u2019t the differentiator.\nHuman Intelligence is.\n\nCoaching can help; let's chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u267b\ufe0f Repost it to your network and follow Joshua Miller for more tips on coaching, AI-era leadership, career + mindset. | #ai #executivecoaching #leadership",

I had assignments for our sessions that helped me to track my behaviors and made the calls productive and focused. After our sessions I implemented his tips and watched my behaviors noticing positive impacts in work environment and personal life. \nOur sessions were well structured and always found value speaking to him and wished I have done my sessions with Josh before in my career. I am extremely grateful to the insights received and the reflections I had in the process.  \nWhat I like the most is how Josh taught me techniques to help me helping myself!  Brilliant! \nIf you feel stuck in your career and need some help to unlock your true potential, I would definitely recommend him.",

Josh\u2019s dig deeper, analytic and interpersonal thoroughness during our team building and Strength Finders off-site made a comprehensive and quantifiable impact on the sales leadership team at Oakley. Undoubtedly one of the best and still talked about and motivating leadership conferences I\u2019ve ever attended. Josh\u2019s style and insightful laser focused approach allowed even the toughest critics to open up, grow and share like never before. Josh is a total pro that I guarantee I will call on again in the future to lead, push and create better leaders for tomorrow. Damn well done!",

        "description": "\"Through an ocean of coaches, Josh stands out\"\n\nThere are a number of reasons a leader may consider hiring a leadership coach. All of the reasons are unique to each leader, but hopefully they are driven from wanting to improve from their current leadership level. There are so many coaches within this field that it can be difficult to find the right one for you. It's an investment for sure. Who do you select?, is there a top x list?, which coach will be a good match for me? I can't answer these questions for you but if you find yourself looking for a leadership coach, I highly recommend you reach out to Josh in your search. \u00a0While you can view his depth in experience, breadth of media distribution avenues, and master coaching credentials in his bio, Josh listens, draws from years of experience and uses tools from his tool bag to fit your current situation.\n\nI have had the pleasure to work with Josh over the past year. With Josh it is a relationship. If you commit to driving areas that you want to focus on with Josh, he can give you tools for success that may feel uncomfortable at times, but eventually will feel natural. You can trust Josh to pay attention to your needs. My biggest win working with Josh has been the increased illumination of my self-awareness. Well then there is the occasional conversation of cars :).",

Josh was always there to help guide me though that next impossible mile, and with his help, I always was able to push though. We quickly became friends and stayed in touch though the years.   Josh's positive energy and drive to achieve his dreams was something I always admired and aspired to achieve in myself.  Which is why, when I came to a crossroads in my life and realized I needed some help, the first person I thought of was Josh.  I hired him as my coach a little less then a year ago and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.  Josh is an incredibly knowledgable coach and a remarkable  listener.   He is very easy to talk to and coaches in a way that never makes you feel judged or guarded.  I found that even though I was going through a very difficult time, I was looking forward to and excited about our sessions.  I left each week with a sense of accomplishment and a better understanding of what I was looking for both in my work and home life. With Josh as my coach, I was able to confidently make difficult decisions in my life that have ultimately led me to a happier and healthier place.  I feel fortunate to have met Josh all those years ago. ",

I've never seen anyone cut through all of the business \"clutter\" as quickly as Josh.  He helped my company put together a best-in-class training plan for our new hires as well as a continuous learning and development program for our existing staff.   Josh always kept us on point.  He was organized, thoughtful, considerate and most importantly, he listened to what we wanted. He didnt make us adopt existing programs or buy any off-the-shelf training products, rather, he innovated and designed processes and programs that were customized specifically for our organization. Not only were these easy to implement- they allowed flexibility for various levels of experience.   Josh slayed our traning and development dragon and made us make training and development both a priority and a reality.   He is truly an expert. His deliverables exceeded our expectations and  made a difference for our business.    Josh was respectful of our business ideas and needs and helped us understand how to achieve our shorter term goals while developing strategy to deliver upon our longer term ones.   The real testament to Josh's success working with Onward Search was that he was considered part of the team almost immediately.  I hope to have the opportunity to work with Josh again soon. He is a great coach, consultant and true professional!",

Even though I have always been goal-driven, our work together has enabled me to more clearly crystalize what is truly important to me and to evolve both as a person and a leader.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Josh so effective as a coach is that he is a truly powerful and compassionate human being who \u201cwalks the walk\u201d and lives his life with the same degree of integrity that he asks of you. He is not afraid to go out on a limb and at times, his intuition or \u201cspidey-sense\u201d as he calls it, can be quite uncanny, helping to shed light and address subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) negative dynamics in the way I am thinking or being that have limited my success in the past.\r\n\r\nOn a practical level, Josh is the personification of an action-oriented taskmaster and I say this with all the kindness in the world. Our work together, frequently involves me stepping beyond my comfort zone, occasionally kicking and screaming, and yet his unwavering commitment to my stated goals has kept me on track and moving forward especially when I hit roadblocks along the way. \r\n\r\nWhether you want to evolve your business, find your life partner, complete a triathlon, or all of the above, Josh is truly inspirational and a powerful person to have on your side. In a nutshell, he helps deliver on the promises you have made to yourself and failed to keep in the past. His contribution to my life has been of immeasurable value and I have nothing but the highest praise for him as a person and as a coach.",

MOOZ helps with it. \n\nDo you agree or disagree with this from your own experience?\nIf you run or teach at a music school, I\u2019d genuinely love to hear your perspective in the comments \ud83d\udc47",

It\u2019s an evolution.\n\nIt succeeded because it refused to abandon:\n \u2022 standards\n \u2022 depth\n \u2022 and respect for the learner\nThat\u2019s the real takeaway for music teachers today.\n\nJuilliard Extension didn\u2019t win by going online.

How We at MOOZ Plan to Eliminate Latency in Online Music Lessons \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to play music together online, you know the pain: it\u2019s impossible to stay in sync. Even a 100 ms delay makes true collaboration impossible. That\u2019s why all \u201conline jams\u201d today are really just people taking turns, not playing together.\n\nAt MOOZ, we decided to change that.\nBecause our platform works with digital instruments as MIDI keyboards, guitars, drums, and violins, we receive the signal in digital form, not through a microphone.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the magic begins: we transmit that digital signal inside our system and synchronously reproduce the sound on the other side.\nThe result? Two people can actually play together in real time, as if sitting at the same instrument: piano-piano, guitar-piano, drums-vocal, any combo works.\nYes, vocals are trickier since the sound still goes through the mic; latency is inevitable.\n\nBut our R&D team is already exploring ways to push that boundary too.\nOur goal is to build the world\u2019s first system that lets musicians play together online with zero latency. Not a simulation, not a recording, but real-time collaboration in the digital space.\n\nMusic should connect people, not separate them by distance.\nAnd we\u2019re building the technology to make that happen.\n\n\n#OnlineMusicLessons\u00a0#RealTimeCollaboration\u00a0\u00a0#MIDIJamSession\u00a0\u00a0#ZeroLatencyMusic\u00a0\u00a0#DigitalInstruments\u00a0\u00a0#RemoteMusicTeaching\u00a0\u00a0#MusicEducationTech\u00a0\u00a0#PlayTogetherOnline\u00a0\u00a0#VirtualJamSession\u00a0\u00a0#SynchronousMusic\u00a0\u00a0#MusicEdInnovation\u00a0\u00a0#MusicianLife\u00a0\u00a0#MusicTechStartup\u00a0\u00a0#CollaborativeMusic\u00a0\u00a0#MusicTeaching",

We are already changing the rules of the game in online lessons: one of our most useful features is support for digital pianos, and we are developing integrations with digital drums, guitars, and violins.\n\nIn 5 years, MOOZ will become the standard for online music education. Which means:\nWe will shape industry trends and define which software and hardware actually work for teachers and students.\n\nWe will become the voice of trust \u2014 from choosing microphones and cameras to recommending instruments.\n\nWe will grow into the main partner for instrument and accessory manufacturers \u2014 Yamaha Corporation, Casio, Roland Corporation U.S., and others.\nYamaha (Marcia Neel, Sotaro Nishida, Jeffrey Scott, John Wittmann, Tom Sumner, Masamitsu KITASE, Cecilia Yue), Casio, Roland \u2014 it\u2019s time to think about this now.\nIn just a few years, we will be selling a record number of instruments and accessories, because MOOZ will become the entry point into music for millions of people.\nWho will dominate online music education in the coming years? The answer is clear: those who build an ecosystem, not just a service.\nMOOZ is not just technology. It is influence on how millions of people learn. And that\u2019s exactly why we will become the largest sales channel for musical instruments in the world. \ud83d\ude80\n\n#music #sales #yamaha #roland #casio #education",

Not only does he have an exceptional range of financial skills but his values and ethics make him a cut above the rest.",

        "description": "I had the pleasure of partnering with Aleyna for a year and a half, during which she helped me hire over 20 people across more than 15 countries. But calling her a recruiting partner undersells what she actually brought to the table. As an Organizational Psychologist and Senior Management Consultant, she was a true thought partner who shaped how I approached hiring, leadership, and team-building\u2014always pushing me to maintain perspective and minimize bias in my decision-making.\nThe results speak for themselves: we built a high-quality, globally diverse team with less than 5% attrition. That doesn't happen by accident.\nWhat sets Aleyna apart is her rare combination of warmth and boldness. She's kind and deeply caring, yet never shies away from challenging perspectives when it matters\u2014always in a way that feels constructive and respectful. She works harder than almost anyone I know and is genuinely committed to creating exceptional experiences for candidates and hiring managers alike.\nIn my many years of hiring, I've never worked with someone who brought this level of dedication, expertise, and care to her work every single day. Any organization lucky enough to work with Aleyna will be better for it.",

Not only was she a great partner but an exceptional leader. She understands how to inspire her org even when the odds aren't great and the deck is stacked against. She finds data and good business process invaluable. During our time her org drove more bookings consistently for the company (by a long shot) than any other area within the organization. She works harder than most and also understands how to prioritize. She isn't afraid of change and will roll up her sleeves to lead by example when needed. If you are looking for one of the best AM leaders out there that can not only drive upsells & retention and also, boost culture then look no further.",

I have worked with a lot of Salesforce admins/leads and he is by the far the best. He is highly knowledgeable but, more importantly, can think outside the box. He understands that, at times, we simply need data and that the system doesn't have to be perfect. He understands what perfect looks like but values execution and iteration above it which is vital in any startup environment. What I liked most about working with him was his positive attitude and energy. We didn't always agree on how something should/could be done but I always left a meeting feeling better than when I started it. He has the makings of a leader and highly collaborative in nature. He would be an invaluable asset to any organization and would be a cultural boost to any team in a big way.",

When I think about the book, The Ideal Team Player, she is humble, hungry, and smart. The thing I appreciate most of all is her attitude. No matter how tough things get she is always a positive presence on the team. She is one of those people you are excited to interact with and lifts those around her up. She has all of the skillsets in the area of Comp but I would also hire her for any role in Revenue Operations side of the business. Her attention to detail, flexibility with ever changing priorities, process driven, and willingness to dig in & figure things out make her an invaluable asset to any organization. I hope we get to work together in the future. But if you are looking for an A player and a significant boost to your culture Deniz would be it!",

But the challenge is, there are very limited reliable options in the market, farmers can trust and use.\n\nCost of ownership, the complexity of implementation, poor connectivity, lack of integratability, and scalability, are the main reasons to stop farmers to rely on the internet of things and benefit from it.\n\n\n\nDIFFERENTIATOR, THAT CHANGES THE GAME\nBacked by more than 20 years of experience in the design and manufacturing of monitoring solutions, FarmTasker is the pioneer solution provider for water management, delivery management, and asset performance monitoring based on LPWAN technologies, specifically designed for agriculture and farming applications.",

Though not a permanent staff member, I always made it a point to acknowledge her, knowing that everyone deserves respect, regardless of their role.\n\nOne day, after weeks of struggling to fill a critical leadership position, Maria noticed my fatigue and asked how I was. I shared my challenge in hiring the right leader. To my surprise, she mentioned knowing someone who could help. Initially unsure, I sent her the job details. Maria passed them to her son, who forwarded them to a former colleague. This led to a reference that helped us find the perfect candidate.\n\nThis experience taught me that respect is not about treating someone higher or lower, but treating everyone the same. In doing so, you open doors to unexpected opportunities and build lasting, meaningful connections.\n\n\n#Leadership #RespectInTheWorkplace #HR #Recruiting #AmazonExperience",

    "about": "I help inclusion leaders transform their practices into measurable business impact engines.\n\nAs a former line executive with multimillion-dollar P&L responsibility, I know firsthand that inclusion isn\u2019t just a value\u2014it\u2019s a growth strategy. Years ago, I led inclusion across a 65,000-employee enterprise and helped unlock hundreds of millions in revenue, reduce costs, and elevate culture simultaneously.\n\nToday, through my coaching and development programs for inclusion leaders, I equip executives to:\n\n- Prove ROI of DEI by connecting initiatives directly to financial outcomes.\n- Secure greater investment by winning C-suite confidence with evidence, not anecdotes.\n- Expand influence by positioning inclusion as a driver of growth, efficiency, and shareholder value.\n- Build lasting strategies that protect against the hidden \u201cexclusion tax\u201d silently draining profits.\n\nI am also Chairman of the CDO PowerCircle, host of the award-winning ERG PowerTalk\u00ae podcast, and a trusted advisor to executives from companies that collectively generate nearly $1 trillion in revenue. Across all these platforms, my mission is consistent: helping leaders replace compliance-driven inclusion with strategic inclusion that fuels enterprise performance.\n\nIf you\u2019re a CDO, inclusion leader, or executive sponsor who wants to go beyond checking boxes to drive measurable results, let\u2019s talk. I offer a free, no-strings-attached Opportunity Scan to help you uncover where exclusion is costing your company\u2014and where inclusion can unlock new growth.",

From CEO\u2019s through CHROs and CDOs, everyone agrees that these groups will continue to play a critical role in their organizational success. From breeding new leaders through making organizations more agile through helping co-create the future structure of the company, ERGs and BRGs will always play an important role. \n\nThe effectiveness of these networks, in turn, is based to a great degree on the skills and passions of their leadership teams. Unfortunately, up until recently, only a few organizations had the budgets to send a few of their ERG leaders to training conferences or to pay someone to come to their company and deliver professional development training to these network leaders. That is until now with ERG PowerTalk. ERG PowerTalk makes employee group leadership development and inspiration available to all, affordable by all, and accessible by all at any time and any place through their mobile devices. In addition to this, forward-thinking organizations that sponsor the podcast also get access to a live 6 part learning series led by top trainer/facilitators for all their ERG/BRG leaders that's valued in the tens of thousands of dollars, freely included with their sponsorship.\n\nTo learn more about this top 5-star rated podcast with thousands of listeners in five English speaking countries, and get more free #ERG / #BRG leadership support resources visit http://ergpowertalk.com",

        "postText": "Inclusion Leaders: You Can\u2019t Win by Playing Defense\n\nInclusion leaders, this image says what many of you are living right now.\nBlocking.\n\nAbsorbing blows.\n\nProtecting what is left of your practice.\n\nMeanwhile, budgets continue to shrink, influence erodes, and decisions get made without you.\n\nDefense alone never wins a fight.\n\nHere is a concise blueprint for winning in this environment:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stop framing inclusion as protection. Executives fund offense, not shields. Tie your work directly to growth, risk reduction, productivity, and market opportunity.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Move from values to value creation. Translate inclusion into revenue lift, faster innovation, better customer access, and operational advantage.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engage power centers, not just allies. Finance, operations, sales, and strategy decide what survives. Build relevance where decisions are made.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choose your punches deliberately. Focus on fewer, high impact initiatives that can show results within 60 to 90 days.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fight forward, not reactively. Set the agenda. Lead with a business case. Force the conversation onto outcomes you can defend.\n\nThis moment does not call for retreat, silence, or going along to get along.\n\nIt calls for taking charge with a disciplined offense.\n\nIf you want practical, business-first strategies for winning this fight and staying relevant as an inclusion leader, subscribe to The Bizclusionist Weekly on Substack. https://lnkd.in/eyz8JDK8\n\nNo platitudes.\n\nNo theater.\n\nJust strategies for leaders who intend to win.\n\n#Bizclusionist #BusinessFirstInclusion #LeadershipStrategy #EnterpriseValue #FutureOfWork",

        "postText": "Let\u2019s be blunt: too many companies have been squandering one of their most valuable strategic assets\u2014ERGs\u2014on \u201csmall potatoes\u201d efforts like heritage month posters, lunch-and-learns, and feel-good volunteering. Meanwhile, competitors who know better are quietly activating these communities to drive business growth, spark innovation, expand markets, and boost performance. And they\u2019re seeing real, measurable returns. If your ERGs are mostly about virtual signaling or culture entertainment, consider this your wake-up call\u2014and a warning. ERGs Were Never Meant to Be Decorative Despite popular belief, ERGs were never designed as \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d They originated to solve costly workplace and marketplace problems by tapping into the lived experiences, insights, and networks of diverse employees to create a competitive business advantage. Somewhere along the way, this powerful purpose got diluted. ERGs became glorified party planners or culture clubs\u2014used to make a good impression without driving substantive organizational change. Now, with DEI efforts under fire, critics say, \u201cThese groups don\u2019t add business value.\u201d And, I'm afraid to say they\u2019re not entirely wrong, but only because many companies have never given ERGs the chance to prove themselves and produce real business results. What the Best Companies Are Doing Differently Leading companies don\u2019t wait to justify ERGs\u2014they activate them as strategic partners. They align ERGs with enterprise-wide business goals, equip ERG leaders with strategic support, and use data to track contributions to innovation, retention, customer engagement, and market intelligence. Consider the company that used its ERGs to test a new product idea\u2014boosting market share in an underserved segment. Or the global firm that co-created a leadership pathway with ERGs cutting first-year turnover by 23%, saving tens to hundreds of millions in a 10,000-employee company. Or the tech company that reengineered onboarding with ERGs and saw engagement scores rise 15% among new hires. These results didn\u2019t happen by accident. They happened because these companies stopped treating ERGs as culture accessories and started investing in them as business drivers. What is the difference between these success stories and companies stuck in virtue-signaling mode? The answer is \u201cHow leaders position, direct, and support their ERGs.\u201d You\u2019re Either Building Leverage\u2014or Losing It Your competitors are waking up to the power of ERGs as strategic assets. Will you? If your ERGs are still relegated to holiday potlucks and cultural programs, you\u2019re not just missing opportunities\u2014you\u2019re falling behind. Leadership today is about outcomes: cost savings, innovation, revenue generation, and market relevance\u2014not optics. And if you fail to demonstrate how ERGs drive those outcomes, someone in your boardroom will eventually ask, \u201cWhy are we doing this at all?\u201d In today\u2019s divided climate, political correctness alone no longer buys goodwill or strategic advantage. If ERGs only make your company look \u201cwoke,\u201d their value will be questioned\u2014and funding cut. ERGs Are Ready to Step Up\u2014Are You Ready to Lead Them? Most ERG leaders want to do more. They want to move beyond \u201ccelebration squads\u201d to become strategic, business-impact-driving teams. They just need permission, clear guidance, and support from leadership to make that shift. Give them that\u2014and watch what\u2019s possible. What You\u2019ll Regret Not Doing Imagine this: six months from now, a competitor leverages their ERGs to co-create a new go-to-market strategy, saving $5 million in R&D and launching eight months ahead of you. Their CDO, once buried in HR, now reports directly to the CEO. Meanwhile, you scramble to defend your shrinking DEI and ERG budget with slides full of Heritage Month photos and pizza receipts. That\u2019s the FOMO moment you want to avoid. In my audits, I routinely find $91 million to $183 million in unrealized profit opportunities\u2014losses any inclusion leader with properly focused ERGS can help fix. It\u2019s Time to Act Stop squandering your ERGs on small efforts. Invest in their strategic transformation. Download my white paper, \u201cERGs as Strategic Assets,\u201d to learn how to: Reposition ERGs for measurable impact Align ERG goals with enterprise priorities Support ERG leaders as business contributors, not just community organizers See examples of companies already doing this successfully Get it now at https://joesantana.gumroad.com/l/xtfrb If you have more questions about how to accelerate your business-impacting ERG efforts, drop me a note. I\u2019m happy to chat. Currently, you may find yourself overwhelmed navigating a world where every word and gesture is scrutinized. But the biggest risk for you isn\u2019t political backlash\u2014it\u2019s being sidelined as an outdated \u201cnice-to-have\u201d initiative that no longer offers clear value. Don\u2019t let that happen on your watch. You have powerful assets ready to demonstrate real business impact. It\u2019s time to put them to work. Think of it like musical chairs: the music\u2019s playing, chairs are being removed, and when the music stops, some will have better seats, some worse, and some none at all. However, unlike musical chairs, your outcome is not determined by fate. It\u2019s really up to you. So, don\u2019t be too busy to act now.",

Will your DEI and ERG efforts become more critical or less important in this emerging world of constant change?

The book results from four years of research into leading publications on the emerging workforce, workplace, and marketplace, pulse surveys, and hundreds of hours of interviews with CEOs, CDOs, ERG leaders, data scientists, and futurists.\n\nIt starts with a look at the history of our ERG practices and their leaders that produced our modern groups. From there, it goes on to give you a glimpse at an incredible future full of faster, more impactful, and sharper disruptions, and one skill you need to master to avoid pitfalls and pounce on opportunities. Next, the book gives you specific practices and tips you can use right away to begin winning in our new disruptive normal.\n\nFilled with stories that sound like they come from a science fiction novel, coupled with practical advice, this book combines future foresight, humor, and practical advice to produce the DEI and ERG leader's most valuable companion into the uncertain future.\n\nClick this link to pre-order an eBook, print, or audio version of this book",

I found him to be a huge asset to me as a leader in our efforts to drive Siemens to the front of the pack in terms of competitiveness in securing and leveraging talent across all dimensions of diversity.  During his term, among other accomplishment the Siemens Energy team successfully expanded their diversity and inclusion efforts beyond the Orlando Florida campus into the highly challenging and rapidly growing production center located in Charlotte North Carolina.  The huge efforts and contributions of Sujith leadership and his teammates during this time also gained external recognition resulting in the earning of two Top Diversity Council Awards from the Association of Diversity Councils\u2019 with a ranking in the top ten in 2011. I believe in great part this success at the Siemens Energy sector council was made possible by Sujith\u2019s ability as a leader to understand opportunities and challenges from both a big picture and detail level and to work effectively with a team to come up with solutions that produced results.",

I am not surprised at his steady increase in scope and responsibility. In each of these roles, Ron has shown himself to be highly engaged and a successful contributor as both participant and leader. For example, in 2011 as Vice Chair of the Diversity Council he was one of the key architects behind the planning and execution of a very successful Diversity Day that resulted in the emergence of new employee resources groups, an increased awareness of diversity across the entire campus workforce and heightened visibility for all of the previously existing employee networks. In my opinion, Ron is a natural leader with a great deal of passion and drive who is always learning, developing and then investing his growing skills in everything he pursues.",

For example, in addition to volunteering from her busy schedule to lead her National network and her contributions during monthly calls with the leaders of other networks across the company, Nadia also founded a Linkedin Group on behalf of Amig@s for all of the company\u2019s employees. To date, she still remains one the most frequent posters to this group, which stands as a testimony to her desire to help and support her colleagues.

        "description": "I worked with Ryan as a senior dev under his Director of Engineering direction at Taylor.\r\nIt was one of the best team development experiences of my life. Ryan has the ability to gather and motivate a group of excellent individuals. The culture of the place is like a startup, but within the bounds of a large, more established company. He keeps the focus on the end goal and makes sure that everyone understands where the team is headed. He has little tolerance for the kind of pettiness that can derail a team and eliminates it by directing everyone back to the purpose of the sprint. He bore the brunt of outside interference, insulating his teams from distractions at a time when the company was refocusing its direction, particularly in technology. He gets the best out of good people. For those who aren't as good for the team, he cuts his and their losses quickly, allowing them to find a better situation for their talents while not dragging the rest of the team down trying to prop up someone who didn't turn out to be the proper fit or able to handle the intensity.\r\nHe encourages growth by junior and senior members. He coached me to help younger members of the group reach their potential. As a result, small intense teams accomplished far more than more experienced teams I've worked with at other companies. The atmosphere is energetic and intense, but satisfying. I've never been so tired at the end of the day, but also proud of the work that we were able to accomplish. Ryan knows how to build that environment and spirit, one of the best managers and people I've known.",

One thing about working with Ryan, is that his goals are very clear, and communication with him is easy and effective.\r\n\r\nRyan is extremely technical for his role, and that benefits not only his team enormously, but any team that needs to interface directly with them.  If I had concerns about the trajectory of a certain project, or if there were processes that could be improved, Ryan is open to criticism and will get his hands dirty on a technical level to correct these things.\r\n\r\nAs for his own team, Ryan acts as a mentor and catalyst to performant and reliable code.  He does things the right way the first time, and isn't in favor of applying band-aid after band-aid until the problem is no longer even recognizable.  Ryan has proven to be a valuable asset to his team as well as mine, and any technical worker would be lucky to report to him.",

This plan included the names and roles of over 50 people that I needed to meet, get to know, and form a relationship with in order to be successful.  Scott took the time to look far ahead in my progression in that new role and plan how to make long-term connections so critical to getting results in a large organization.  I have never had an onboarding plan like it, and I doubt I ever will again.\n\nHe is well versed on software development patterns as well as project and product management.  His greatest strength lies in his ability to form and maintain connections with vast numbers of people, a huge asset in a large company like First American.\n\nScott is a thoughtful leader and one that listens well in addition to being very clear on setting expectations.

In that time, I watched her grow as an engineer, develop her innate leadership abilities, and ensure her future as an indispensable part of any software engineering team.\n\nSwathi is strong full stack (Java, JavaScript (AngularJS), Cassandra, PostgresQL, AWS) engineer, a great collaborator, and advocate for Agile.  She always strives for quality as demonstrated by her eagerness to pick up testing suites (e.g. Jasmine, Protractor) and ensure the solutions are complete, accurate, and scalable.\n\nHer leadership from within the team was exceptional.  She mentors new team members without hesitation and in a very deliberate way ensuring the new team member feels included and grounded.  She was the first on the team to attain an AWS certification and then immediately spent time as a guide for the other team members through this difficult and sometimes arduous journey of learning.  She is a capable presenter and comfortable speaking in front of groups.\n\nOne of Swathi's most outstanding traits would be her ownership.  I knew, without a doubt, if Swathi said she \"had it\", she did.  No matter the task, or challenge, from front-end development to maintaining legacy systems to interfacing directly with customers to designing data models,  Swathi's sense of ownership and pride in her work gave me the confidence to continually push and challenge her.  \n\nAny team, regardless of level or direction, would benefit from her technical acumen, her drive, and her consistent demonstration of leadership at all levels.  Working closely with her she taught me many things, and I have no doubt she will excel and bring value to anything to which she sets her mind.",

        "description": "John is easily the most technical leader I have ever had, but he is tempered enough to not interfere directly with the individual contributors or leadership under him.\r\n\r\nJohn is loyal and resilient, always driven and determined to make the most positive impact on the company and the people around him day after day.  I watched John stay until the early morning hours giving support to us as we worked through technical issues or releases, even though he didn't write any of the code being promoted. He continuously acts as a servant leader by offering advice, helping in the trenches, and keeping the caffeine flowing.  Even after a 20 hour day, a few short hours later, John would be back at the office to give first line customer, both internal and external, support keeping the technical resources freed up to react to unanticipated eventualities.\r\n\r\nI would work with John anywhere, anytime, on anything.  I will always continue to think the extraordinary example of a leader which he exemplifies, and use those lessons in my own career.",

I found her knowledgeable and approachable and thoroughly enjoyed working with her.  Her ability to convey complex details in an organized and logical manner facilitated easy communication and high productivity as technical needs were met quickly and efficiently. \r\n\r\nI would look forward to working with her again in whatever capacity we might find ourselves.",

That being said, Luke took it, and grew it using both his extensive marketing knowledge and acumen as well as his innate salesmanship.  I watched sales pulled out of thin air due to Luke and his team's ability to understand our customers and then reach them, where they are, in such a way that it felt natural and easy, not a hard sale, but something that just flowed.\r\n\r\nRegardless of where I end up, I would always keep Luke in mind for any outside or inside sales as well as any social media/new media marketing needs. I am confident he would approach it with the same drive and unique outlooks as I have experienced working with him at DIT, and I would welcome it.",

I'm impressed by her innate ability to adapt and turn change into opportunities. Anita has taken video @ Bain to amazing new heights. She's built a department from the ground up and continues to find ways to grow this to ensure she's meeting the needs of the firm. She is often working with in tight timelines and strict budgets, but somehow still is able to make the magic happen and bring our brand to life through video. In addition, Anita is always the first to raise her hand for new initiatives (even outside of her job scope) which continues to lead us to new places/new ideas/new ways of working. Her leadership is exceptional...she's continually trying to find ways to deliver results and add value to Bain's business. She never stops with the status quo. She truly cares about delivering the best that she has and won't stop until it's done (and even then, she's onto the next thing).

While leading a complex cloud migration assessment & strategy program for a Fortune 100 customer organization, Srini was the principal architect on my team. Srini's technology depth, strategic thinking, and tactical efficiency & effectiveness, made him the key pillar of this program. His ability to strategically and tactically re-pivot based on changing situations, is absolutely admirable. Likewise, his innovative approaches in resolving critical blockers, made a marked difference. Srini is excellent at collaborating with, and mentoring large, diverse cross-geography teams. His commitment, bias for action, and result orientation, make him stand out distinguished. Towards the last leg of my tenure with Wipro, we had the opportunity to work together again, for a large program involving modernizing a 40+ year old mainframe platform to a distributed architecture. Srini is a great asset for any organization, with all attributes of an outstanding techno-leader. I cannot wait to work with him again.",

        "description": "It was a pleasure to collaborate with Mikhail on implementing a real-time agent assist technology for Verizon's consumer call centers. This groundbreaking ML based system provided sub-second recommendations to over 40,000 agents, supporting 700-800k calls daily.\n\nAs a rigorous technical leader, Mikhail owned the entire product development lifecycle. He integrated enterprise data, designed AI algorithms, built and scaled ML models, and trained Verizon to operate and improve them. Mikhail then operationalized new recommendation types for various customer service groups, successfully transferring the system to my team.\n\nThe innovative system Mikhail architected delivered substantial and sustained ROI to Verizon over many years in production. His critical contributions profoundly impacted our customer care operations, and improved customer satisfaction levels.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Mikhail as a preeminent AI expert for customer care operations and an energetic technical leader with the depth and experience to bring ambitious enterprise projects to production scale.",

During the interview itself it was apparent that Qandeel had mastered the technology. During his 2+ years on the project he was instrumental in architecture, design and implementation of complex and key functionality. \r\n\r\nHis work ethics and dedication to solving tough solutions was admired and appreciated by business partners and peers alike. He was a highly respected mentor and guide for all other developers. \r\n\r\nFrom a technology perspective I would rate Qandeel in the top 20 Drupal/PHP developers in the world, based on his contributions and feedback from technical luminaries who assisted with the project.\r\n\r\nQandeel will be an asset  to any project. Given the correct circumstances I would have no hesitation in welcoming him back to my organization.",

    "about": "I have had the opportunity to work in most areas of a SaaS technology company. I work best when scaling and building organizations, driving the strategy, hiring the team and executing.  My ~20 years in tech working at great companies such as OpenAir (acquired by NetSuite), NetSuite (acquired by Oracle), ForeSee (acquired by Verint) and Litmus (acquired by Validity) have demonstrated that alignment across the organization at all levels on the vision and mission is critical to driving broader success.  Before my ~20 years in technology, I dabbled in strategy consulting at Bain & Company, where I had the pleasure of working with some of the smartest people in the world. I was humbled every day that I came to work.  \n\nUltimately, I enjoy setting strategy, leading and developing teams, executing to hit key metrics and grooming talent.  Nothing gives me greater pleasure than when our team succeeds or when a customer tells me they love our product and enjoy working with our company.\n\nWhen not working, I can be found practicing yoga or lifting heavy weights over my head, planning or experiencing my next international vacation, training for a road race or spending time with my wife and kids.",

While she possesses numerous skills and attributes that have made her successful throughout her career, I believe her number one asset is her sheer horsepower and intelligence.  Jessica is bright, articulate and analytical.  She is adept at understanding and dissecting critical client issues into smaller, core problems and then working with the appropriate internal resources to address the concerns.   But Jessica is not all brains. She has strong relationship management skills, allowing her to work successfully with diverse groups of people, from engineers and sales people internally to all levels of personnel at our clients, including C-level executives.  \r\n\r\nIf I were in the capacity to work with Jessica in the future or hire her into another company, I would so without hesitation and with great enthusiasm.",

He is a highly qualified corporate finance executive with deep expertise in global financial management, M&A due diligence and integration, SEC reporting and personnel management.  Importantly, Ron possesses excellent interpersonal relations skills, and is adept at communicating effectively across cultures as well as with the board of directors and investors.\n\nRon teams well with others.  I observed him on several occasions interacting successfully with teams as disparate as subsidiary finance teams, external auditors, cross-functional project teams and M&A due diligence teams.  Crucially, he was instrumental to my own successful integration at Rogers, proactively helping me to learn the ropes.\n\nHe is technically sound, with an admirable grasp of technical accounting issues such as derivative accounting, pension accounting and purchase price accounting.\n\nThere is no doubt that he possesses excellent executive credentials.  He presented to the board of directors on a regular basis and earned their trust and respect.  He was also the company\u2019s representative in dealing with partners and senior managers of various audit and advisory firms, and was consistently skilled at articulating and advocating for the company\u2019s operational and strategic objectives.\n\nRon is a true professional and was a gifted ambassador for our company.

The greatest praise I can give to him is to declare that I would enjoy working with him again if the opportunity arises.\n",

        "summary": "Business leaders routinely invest significant resources to develop and deliver ambitious business plans, taking time and great care to work through the strategic, operational and financial details. But the essential contribution of key people, and hence skills, to the successful implementation of the strategy is often neglected. Consequently, a damaging imbalance emerges between growth targets and the core capabilities required to achieve those goals.\n\nThis disconnect has become exacerbated in recent years. As IT becomes a more critical enabler of business today, many IT organizations have failed to adopt a comprehensive human capital strategy. While much focus has been placed on systems, technical capabilities and IT assets, ensuring that the organization has the proper talent in place and is equipped with the right skills to align with and drive the evolving business capabilities of the enterprise has typically taken a back seat.\n\nAlthough the effects are not always immediately obvious, experience has shown that the inability to predict key skills requirements and ensure that the right talent is in place when and where needed undermines business performance in the long term. The results are missed growth targets, mediocre productivity and higher recruiting costs.",

        "summary": "Whether facing the challenges of austerity measures and regulatory changes, an increasingly dynamic and globalized business environment, or the difficulties posed by an ever more complex digital and data-driven market, defining the right target operating model is crucial for steering the course to profitable growth. As an overall operations and technology ecosystem, a target operating model serves as a company\u2019s blueprint for achieving its strategic vision.\n\nRealizing the full benefits of a target operating model, however, and regularly adapting it to continually shifting business strategies, can pose significant challenges. No single, ideal target operating model exists. Rather, each company\u2019s model design will depend on its starting point, culture and the optimization goals it has prioritized based on its business strategy, market position and areas of competition, and differentiated client value proposition.",

        "summary": " Today, most organizations are facing two major challenges: business uncertainty and an accelerated pace of change. They face adaptive challenges\u2014 global changes in societies, markets, customers, competition and technology\u2014which are forcing them to clarify their values, develop new strategies and learn new ways of operating. In this uncertain environment, companies must execute on an increasingly complex stage. The ability to develop and implement new strategic initiatives and change gears rapidly is becoming a key differentiator and area of competitive advantage.\n\nYet many companies struggle to successfully execute on these strategic initiatives. The difficulty is blindly attributed to shortcomings in leadership, while, in reality, it is largely associated with ineffective engagement and management. Many senior executives struggle with getting the information they need\u2014when they need it\u2014to make the necessary adjustments and course corrections that are critical to ensuring that large strategic initiatives deliver their target impact.\n\nKurt Salmon has identified four pillars that shape the framework for the next-generation Enterprise PMO and which will improve the odds of successfully delivering strategic initiatives.",

        "summary": " For years, companies have been pouring money into resources, processes, and technologies that can help them manage risk.\n\nRisk management involves a judicious mix of preventing the risks that can reasonably be controlled, learning to recognize the ones that can\u2019t be prevented, being prepared to react to minimize damage, and having the resources to recover from the problems that do occur. Technology is an essential component to succeeding in today\u2019s business environment and companies recognize that the complexities of technology require a commitment to the development of more robust capabilities to manage risk and create a more risk-aware culture. Industries with the highest dependency on technology are faced today with the competing requirements of providing a stable, reliable, low cost technology platform for daily business operations (\u201cRun the Business\u201d) and also providing a dynamic, flexible, cost effective capability to modify the technology platform in response to technology or business imperatives (\u201cChange the Business\u201d).",

His vision in preempting client needs has led to some of the best and most satisfying projects I have been involved in.\r\n \r\nHe is a natural leader when it comes to getting the most out of his team and delivering value to the client. He always expects the highest standards in delivery and leads by example. He was also a great mentor and coach to everyone on the team, always pushing us to expand our abilities and to pick up new skillsets. It says a lot about his work ethic that at one point he was managing about 4 projects simultaneously still managed to do justice to all of them.\r\n \r\nI am sure Simo will be a dynamic leader at any firm and bring the best out of any team that he works with!",

        "postText": "\ud83c\udf0a  Growing up as a sailor, I developed a deep passion for the ocean. That same passion led me to start Ammobia 25 years later \u2014 with a clear mission: to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like shipping with technologies that deliver both climate impact and positive ROI.\n\n\u2693  Just days ago, governments at the International Maritime Organization decided not to adopt its proposed Net Zero Framework \u2014 the world\u2019s first global carbon pricing system for international maritime emissions. This is more than a missed policy vote. It\u2019s a setback for collective climate action \u2014 and for the 3% of global GHG emissions that the maritime industry represents.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 A few weeks ago, I stepped aboard Fortescue Green Pioneer (Thanks to Bennett Cohen & Yash Rane \ud83d\ude4f ), an ammonia-fueled vessel proving that the technology works and crews can feel safe operating it. The future is here \u2014 it just needs the right incentives to scale. \n\n\ud83d\udef3\ufe0f  Just like Fortescue, many other global shipping giants have been leading this transition: Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., Yara International, CMB.TECH and more. Not just because they care about our planet, but because they know it is what it takes unlock long-term value and competitiveness.  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 At Ammobia, we\u2019re pushing boundaries every day to make ammonia affordable and accessible because the shipping industry deserves better options than waiting.\n\n\ud83c\udd99  Progress may be delayed, but it\u2019s far from over. Failure is not final.. it is the courage to continue that counts! Let\u2019s keep sailing forward.\n\n#decarbonization #shipping #ammonia #cleantech #energytransition #IMO",

Narendra Modi and fellow founders from the IndiaAI ecosystem.\nWhat stood out was the clarity and consistency of the vision and direction provided. We got a chance to present an update on the Unified Artificial Intelligence layer (UAI) that we are building (UPI for AI).  \n\nA few reflections I\u2019m taking back with me:\n- India\u2019s real advantage in AI lies not just in innovation, but in large-scale, real-world implementation \u2014 moving beyond pilots to outcomes that touch everyday lives.\n- The emphasis on AI for societal good reinforces the need to focus on harder, more consequential problems in agriculture, healthcare, education, skilling, and governance.\n- Building AI that is accessible and easy to adopt will be as important as the sophistication of the models themselves \u2014 especially at India scale.\nIndigenous data, local languages, and cultural context are not constraints; they are India\u2019s strategic strengths.\n\nAt Avataar, this interaction strengthens our conviction to keep building AI systems that serve citizens, MSMEs, and public institutions, and to do so in a way that reflects India\u2019s diversity and values.\n\nExcited to collaborate with the broader IndiaAI community and translate this shared vision into tangible impact. \n\nThanks to Hon'ble Ministers Shri. Ashwini Vaishnaw and Shri. Jitin Prasada, Secretary Shri. S Krishnan for giving this energy boost! \n\nSpecial call out to IndiaAI Mission CEO Shri. Abhishek Singh, Shri.
