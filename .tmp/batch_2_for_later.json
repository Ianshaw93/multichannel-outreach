    "summary": "AI is flattening organizations faster than most leaders can adapt. Skilled managers are downsized. Layers are shrinking. Work is speeding up. And leadership models built on control and hierarchy are breaking down. I provide architecture that makes teams self-managing for Fractionals, Business Owners, Consultants and Coaches. Leaders and HR partners tell me the same thing: “We know collaboration matters—but we can’t measure it, sustain it, or scale it.” That’s where the TIGERS® 6 Principles System comes in. It equips leaders and HR partners to turn AI-driven flattening into a human advantage through measurable trust, collaboration, and engagement. For more than 30 years, I’ve helped organizations—from Fortune 500s to nonprofits—create high-trust, self-aligning cultures that thrive in complexity. The TIGERS System builds six measurable principles that drive collaboration: Trust | Interdependence | Genuineness | Empathy | Risk Resolution | Success. These aren’t soft skills. They’re behavioral metrics that leaders can observe, measure, and scale. That’s why we license this framework to coaches, consultants, and HR partners who want to deliver sustainable, people-centered transformation that makes work easier not harder. When trust becomes measurable, transformation becomes unstoppable.

    "summary": "From a young age, I’ve had an innate desire to help people. Whether it was identifying problems when no one else was looking, asking the probing questions that every parent dreads, or offering solutions—sometimes unsolicited—I was always driven to make things better. If you had asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answers would have included lawyer, police officer, or doctor. As I got older, I knew those weren't right for me. My career journey has taken me through various sectors, including small to medium-sized businesses, the service industry, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C., a mega-church, and local government. In each organization, I consistently sought to understand the challenges at hand. I asked questions, identified issues, and proposed solutions—some welcomed, others less so. Regardless of the setting, my focus remained on finding the most strategic and logical paths forward. This involved refining existing processes and systems. One recurring theme across all these organizations was a lack of clarity in management and leadership. Employees often struggled with unclear expectations, resulting in low morale and plenty of “water cooler” conversations post-meetings. Furthermore, genuine people development was frequently overlooked. Through my diverse work experiences and education, I discovered the sweet spot where my skills and passions intersected. Today, I have the privilege of helping businesses transform their operations and cultures. I collaborate closely with business owners to diagnose their challenges and craft tailored growth strategies. The best part? They define what success looks like for them, and together we build a roadmap to achieve it. Are You Facing These Challenges? ⏩ Is your business growing but you're unsure how to sustain that momentum? ⏩ Is your team not performing at the level you know they can? ⏩ Are you bogged down by a lack of clarity and ineffective processes that hinder your growth? ⏩ Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed as a business owner or CEO and longing for more balance in your life? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, I want to invite you into a conversation. This initial conversation will help us diagnose the issues within your business and identify actionable strategies you can implement right away.

Women served on some committees but, were not allowed to hold office and did not have voting privileges. Because women were paid lower salaries in those days, most women could not afford to join the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1950, that all changed. Martha McKinley received permission from the President of the Chamber to form a “Women’s Section”, with dues more affordable to the working women of that time. They were to have their own Officers and Bylaws. For the next 40 years, the Women’s Section acted as a support group for the Chamber. In 1990 it was time for a change and thus evolved the Fresno County Women’s Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) organization. Our mission is to provide and promote professional opportunities, personal development, financial growth, community leadership and legislative awareness for women. We believe in supporting each other and watching our members’ successes. By encouraging others to do business with fellow members, members see their business and friendships grow.

I was surrounded by leaders in the wrong positions and people in positions of authority who had no business being there. I want to give people who are considering leadership, those in leadership who are struggling, and executives who are over their heads an opportunity to develop before they hurt someone or themselves. I want to see the day when workers do not have to go home and consume their dinner and talk about the underdeveloped and unprepared leaders they work for. Do you know the leader I am talking about or is that you? Ok, so here is all the other stuff people want to see: I am a Best-selling author of A Lion's Pride: The Scars That Silenced Kings, and I co-authored Voices for Leadership: Your Pathway to Becoming a More Influential Leader, The Latino Leadership Playbook, and Latinos 100. I have served as an Executive, Business Owner, Veteran & Advocate, Board Member, Non-Profit Administrator, Speaker, Mentor, Coach, and Avid Volunteer. Over the past 30 years, I have held numerous executive advisor and senior positions while serving in the United States Navy and civilian sector. Through education and training, I helped strengthen the chain of command and businesses, providing sound decision support and creating open communication at all levels. I also helped formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, and training of Navy and civilian personnel. My performance won me the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. I was named 2013, 2014, and 2017 Mentor of the Year, and recipient of the inaugural 2014 Chief John Dungan Jr. Oceanographer of the Navy Award. I was also awarded The Arnold Fletcher Award and inducted into the SALUTE National honors society for my academic achievements. I volunteer actively for various projects and non-profits, earning the esteemed Bronze, Silver, and Gold President’s Volunteer Service Award. I host the Award-Winning Developing the Leader Within Podcast. On the DTLW Podcast, I share real-world leadership lessons shaped by my personal experiences, challenges, and victories. Having overcome significant obstacles, including 26 years of Naval service, I know what it takes to lead with resilience and authenticity.

Every organization that ignores the Culture Gap ends up paying for it: through lost revenue, disengaged talent, failed synergies, and missed opportunity. As a leader in a global company you have a choice: Talk to a cross-cultural expert now, or call them when the damage is done. Either way, you'll need to address culture… because it always shows up.

They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences. Failing to communicate, manage, inspire, and lead across cultural differences is a huge risk for these companies, and the lack of cultural competence can be a bottom-line relevant issue.

    "summary": "If you are a CEO, entrepreneur or business owner pursuing mergers or acquisitions as part of your growth strategy, let’s talk. There’s a reason CEO's call me an \"M&A Whisperer\". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the \"unexpected people challenges\" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, \"NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions\" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc. Honored as Entrepreneur of the Year by Northshore Women in Business in 2019, I was recently ranked the #1 M&A Leadership Consultant by Leadership Research Institute and nominated to Thinkers50 2024 Radar list of future management thinkers to watch.

    "summary": "I'm not an exit consultant. I help owners build businesses they never want to sell. (Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: \"I can't take a real vacation without chaos\" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: \"I need to scale but organic growth is too slow\" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: \"I want options but don't know where to start\" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: \"It's time. Get me the best outcome possible\" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison. Multiple options = freedom. 📊 Find out where you stand: Send me a message and let's talk about where you are and where you want to be. 📚 Or start with my book: \"Unlocking Small Business Value\" The playbook I wish I'd had for my first acquisition: https://grw.bz/unlock P.S.

    "summary": "Are you a leader, social entrepreneur, or creative professional feeling disconnected from your purpose, struggling to balance impact with personal well-being, or finding yourself stuck in old patterns? Do you find your team stuck in old patterns, rehashing past challenges instead of moving towards a more generative future? As a social entrepreneur, are you struggling to align your deep values with your daily actions, and find a clear path to making the impact you desire? At Heyman Partners, we understand these challenges. We help leaders, social entrepreneurs, and creative professionals move past these obstacles to achieve impact with joy through integrated growth and aligned purpose. We guide individuals and organizations to the sweet spot where they can make a real difference while maintaining a deep sense of fulfillment. I've worked with many leaders who, while managing people and resources, guiding strategy and implementation, and confronting disagreement, sometimes neglect their own internal boundaries, leading to overwhelm and burnout. I've also learned that while occasionally rehashing \"war stories\" can be instructive, focusing on those times can keep you and your team stuck in the past, rather than moving towards a generative future. In my work, I help my clients learn to develop healthy boundaries, shift away from trauma bonds, and move forward with generative energy. Here’s what some of my clients say: “I threw out a number of goals and within 20 minutes we had compelling and inspiring direction.” “She has twice lead out team in decision making that enabled us to thrive and grow as an organization.” “She could cut to the heart of an issue and help us find our way there, and also a path forward.” Are you or your team ready to discover your sweet spot where impact and joy intersect? We believe that clarity of purpose, quality of interaction, and aligned action can transform your work and life, leading to more sustainable and generative outcomes. If you are ready to bring joy and fulfillment back into your work, and align your values and actions for a greater impact, visit my website in my profile section to learn more about our integrative approach to growth and how we can help you find your sweet spot.",

    "summary": "I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

    "company_description": "As the CEO of a mid-sized service enterprise, are you aiming for dramatic revenue growth–ranging from a solid 25% to an ambitious 100%? Is your vision for growth failing to inspire enthusiastic followership? Do your ideas get brushed aside? Are strategic misalignments and execution uncertainties sapping your team’s energy and direction? Imagine pinpointing your next $10-$100 million in revenue, with your team aligned and clear on their future goals, and where your leadership is heard and understood. The challenge often lies in clinging to outdated strategies. For years, your teams have been incentivized to keep what’s in place going. Anything ‘new’ might get in the way, add risk, or slow things down. They don’t see that one of the greatest risks in business today is not adapting on purpose and by design. With over 25+ years of experience in pioneering first-of-their-kind projects, I’ve driven over $2 billion in unprecedented sales growth through strategic market entries, service expansions, and enhanced customer experiences. I also fueled over $500 million in sales by repositioning brands, crafting exit valuation stories, and unlocking new channels and opportunities. Consultants come and go, but Mike’s commitment to our growth has been unwavering since he helped us redefine our brand. Mike empowered us to become the brand we aspired to be, giving us permission to jettison the limiting preconceptions. Since our initial collaboration, we’ve experienced a tenfold increase in growth–achievements we could not have reached without his insight and guidance. – Christoper Iansiti - Board Chair For transformative revenue growth of 25-100%, contact me at +1 404.229.5809 for a confidential conversation.",

    "summary": "WHAT I DO: For more than 35 years and over 600 engagements, I have rapidly helped companies with revenue $5MM to $50MM fix their cash flow and plan cash flow and operations changes for future profitability. Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher™. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME™) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME™ trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach™ program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)– because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME™ company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment – again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours. Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,620,000,000 in debt and saved 14,731 jobs.

    "job_description": "WHY IT MATTERS: Cash flow is the life-blood of your business. When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher™ tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME™ helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME™ gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years. STATISTICS: Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,355,000,000 in debt and saved 13,414 jobs. WHAT I DO: cash flow coaching, turnaround consulting, turnaround management, change company outcomes, restructure debt, refinance distressed companies, sell distressed companies, TAME™, Cash Flow Launcher™, free cash flow model.",

I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs.

For over 17 years, I’ve partnered with CEOs, executive teams, and boards across venture capital, private equity, and Fortune 100 companies to align people strategies with business strategies, creating cultures that drive performance and innovation. As a C-suite Advisor on Talent, I specialize in helping leaders thrive amid uncertainty. My approach is rooted in understanding the complex interplay between people and organizations—designing strategies that not only meet immediate business needs but also foster long-term growth and resilience. I’ve had the privilege of consulting for global organizations, including Nike, Amazon, McKinsey, and Microsoft, as well as scaling startups, guiding them through inflection points that required deep leadership transformation and organizational redesign. Leadership, in my view, is not just about the individual; it’s about the intersection of culture, strategy, and human dynamics. By aligning human capital strategy with business objectives, organizations can navigate complexity and achieve sustainable success. I believe that trust, agility, and strategic talent development are essential for any organization looking to thrive in today’s rapidly changing landscape. As a reticulist, I bring together diverse, often unlikely, groups of people to create innovative solutions to today’s most pressing challenges. By convening different perspectives, I believe we can drive breakthroughs that push the boundaries of what’s possible—whether in business transformation, innovation, or addressing societal needs.

    "summary": "Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS. Track Record - Creator of the ROE (Return on Empathy) model and International Best Selling Author - Global keynote speaker on empathy, EQ psychological safety (U.S., Africa, Europe, SE Asia) - 25+ years leading teams in engineering, construction & high-risk government projects - Leading organizations from accidental to intentional cultures, rooted in their values and aligned with their vision. - Sparring partner for leaders across STEM, Operations and Federal Government Ready to turn empathy into your next strategic advantage?

I began in frontline child welfare work and moved into county, regional, and statewide leadership roles—eventually serving as Deputy Director, Director of Field Operations, and Chief of Staff for the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services. Across those roles, I led major reforms, built strong teams, and helped leaders navigate high-risk environments. After retiring from state service in 2018, I shifted into consulting and coaching. I am also the head coach and owner of Drive Multisport, where I coach triathletes, runners, and ultra-distance athletes. As a 10-time Ironman finisher and Boston Marathon qualifier, I draw on years of endurance training and athlete development in my coaching work. Today my primary focus is writing and faith-focused work. I’m the author of The Long Way Home: A Catholic Return to Faith, published by Wipf and Stock in 2025, which shares my return to the Church and offers encouragement for others hoping to reconnect with their faith. I’m drawn to roles and projects that combine leadership, mission, clarity, and service—especially those that help people or organizations grow stronger in purpose.

Here's what that looks like ↓ >> How it started: A few years ago my CEO said, \"We need you to AI-ify this company.\" I was Chief of Staff. Not a developer. But I knew where the problems were. So I figured it out. Built things. Broke things. Built them better. >> What I learned: While the tech is (still) hard to wrap your head around, getting it to work as hoped and get the ROI you think it should comes from: 1. Understanding what AI can actually do (past the hype) 2. Finding the problems worth solving first 3. Building solutions people actually use >> Who I have helped: - Ops leaders at growth-stage startups - Founders building their first AI workflows for AI-first scaling - RevOps teams buried in manual work - Solopreneurs making AI useful for their business ...all spanning SaaS, talent & recruiting, real estate, non-profits, and more. >> The common thread? Pretty much the same thing every time. They see the AI opportunity. It's obvious something's there. But there's a gap between seeing it and actually using it. That's what I help close. >> How we work together: Learn (build your own capability): → Follow along here - I share what's actually working for me and others! → Subscribe to my newsletter - https://harrysiggins.substack.com/ → Courses - see featured section for cohorts! → Manual Override - an accelerator supporting solopreneurs and fractional execs in building AI-forward businesses (https://www.manualoverride.co/) Build (I work alongside you): → Consulting projects (agents, workflows, and training) → Retainers for ongoing build work and advisory >> What changes: You know what the before looks like. ! AI that seems impressive but doesn't apply to your work. ! A mental list of \"try this\" ideas that never go anywhere. ! Tools you've signed up for and stopped using. ! The feeling that everyone else figured this out already. That's the gap. Seeing the opportunity but not closing it. But once you do: * You know what AI can do for YOUR work in theory AND practice. * You have capability. Skills to do it yourself, systems I built with you, or both. * The next AI opportunity is easier to see and easier to act on because you've done it once now. * You're not someone who talks about AI anymore. You're someone who uses it. * You run an AI-first operation, team, and company. --- DM me or book a call: onetwogrowth.com",

Clients often say I bring clarity where there’s complexity. I create space for meaningful conversations — calmly, with focus and without pressure. With a systemic lens, I help teams reconnect to what matters, reshape the way they collaborate, and regain sustainable momentum. What sets me apart is the balance I bring: • A practical, analytical mind — grounded in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt level), and a PhD in chemistry • A calm, human presence — able to surface hidden tensions, build trust, and mobilise teams around shared purpose • A strategic posture — focused on results that are both measurable and lasting • A practitioner-researcher mindset — where curiosity fuels continuous learning and deepens the value of my work for clients I bring a strong foundation in operational realities — from the shop floor to senior leadership — combined with certifications in Lean Six-Sigma, Human Centered Design, Executive and Team Coaching, as well as diagnostic tools in Team 360, change leadership and resiliency. In person or virtually, I partner with leadership teams to align with clarity, move forward with cohesion, and generate strategic momentum that lasts.

Our approach is grounded in over 20 years of experience leading high-stakes initiatives in both the private and public sectors. It’s strengthened by deep expertise in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt), human-centred design, and a rigorous scientific foundation (PhD in chemistry). What we’ve learned — time and again — is that no strategy, however robust, leads to sustainable change without healthy team dynamics. As Drucker said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” That’s why we approach every engagement through a dual lens: cross-functional collaboration and relational depth. Because lasting transformation isn’t driven by plans alone — it’s carried by the people who bring them to life. You might be realigning your leadership team, exploring new ways of working, or working to rebuild trust and cohesion — whether in the wake of a challenging period or right in the midst of it.

    "company_description": "Welcome to the Crowell School of Business where we provide a distinctive approach to business leadership. We call it Business as Ministry. Why is this important? Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact. At Crowell, business education is designed so you learn and put into practice career-relevant business skills while engaging your faith and launching your career. We invite you to learn more about our School and programs by following us on LinkedIn and going to our web page. Or even better: come by and visit us some time!",

Nearly 19 million people in the US live in “food deserts”, meaning they don’t live near a grocery store. It’s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I’m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can “see” how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don’t excite them or detract from what they love working on. What kind of food sustainability projects are you trying to build? I'd love to listen and see how I can support your efforts.",

    "summary": "I’m Keith Liscio, the Founder and President of Excelsior Franchise Center. My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners.

    "summary": "Most teams I work with don’t have a pipeline problem. They have a decision and conversion problem. Deals stall once they enter the organization. Champions lose momentum. Approvals slow. Revenue looks committed but never actually lands.

I work inside live deals, coaching founders and reps where decisions are breaking down, not periodically reviewing dashboards after the fact. Part founder advisor. Part deal strategist. Part GTM architect. How I help: • Diagnose where deals are truly failing: decision ownership, internal alignment, risk tolerance, or economic justification • Coach founders through commercial sequencing, trade-offs, and hard calls that teams avoid making• Work directly inside active deals to equip champions with forwardable, CFO-ready business cases that survive executive scrutiny • Establish a simple operating rhythm that improves deal quality, speed, and predictability without adding process overhead Typical outcomes: • Six- and seven-figure opportunities reactivated after stalling• Material reductions in deal cycle time once decision friction is addressed • Clear internal narratives that unlock approvals without escalation• Founders regaining control of revenue conversations with boards and investors • Improved revenue execution preceding successful acquisitions I’m not a generic founder coach, and I’m not a fractional CRO. Those roles often diagnose problems after the window to act has passed. I specialize in one thing: Turning existing demand into closed revenue by fixing conversion at the point where decisions actually fail. If you’re carrying CEO and CRO responsibilities and deals are slowing inside the funnel, I help you make better revenue decisions and close what’s already on your desk.",

    "summary": "A while back, I found myself at a crossroads.I wanted my next role to check three key boxes:✔ Work with a leader I respected (or better yet, was inspired by)✔ Be part of a company whose mission excited me✔ Fit into a culture where people actually thrive. Then I realized – finding all three was like looking for a needle in a wheat field.So, I stopped looking and started reflecting. What I really love—the work that fires me up—is helping leaders and teams find their power and perform at their potential. Across my career, whether I was turning around a struggling nonprofit, helping to scale a cybersecurity firm, working on the Olympics, or running my own business, I kept seeing the same issue:➡️ Companies often put good people in leadership roles without the right training or support.➡️ Those leaders struggle, which leads to frustration, turnover, and wasted potential.➡️ The business suffers, and no one wins. But when companies get it right—when they develop strong leaders, put people in roles that fit their strengths, and create a culture where teams perform. That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees. I do this through leadership coaching, advisory, and fractional executive support, powered by data-driven tools like leadership diagnostics, psychometric assessments, and culture analytics. Leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about unlocking potential. When you get that right, performance, retention, and engagement follow naturally. Curious where to start? If you’re wondering whether your leadership team is aligned or your culture is working for—or against—you, try my quick Leadership Alignment Diagnostic (no cost). It’s a short series of questions that reveals where your biggest opportunities lie.👉 Book a complimentary 20-minute call, or message me “FindMyMana” to start the diagnostic.",

The foundation’s name, “GIFT,” reflects our core mission: to help individuals Reflect God’s Image and Fulfill their Talent in service to others. By empowering mothers to heal and thrive, we aim to glorify God through purposeful living. How We Help: At the You Are a GIFT Foundation, we focus on partnering with local organizations and nonprofits to address the unique challenges mothers face on the journey to becoming addiction-free. Through strategic collaborations, we provide: - Access to education and rehabilitation programs. - Tailored solutions to overcome obstacles preventing recovery. - Awareness campaigns to promote addiction prevention and family restoration. Our work is centered on offering a pathway for mothers to rebuild their lives, strengthen their families, and reclaim their purpose. Why We Exist: Prescription drug addiction often leaves mothers struggling to navigate the path to recovery alone. Our foundation exists to fill this gap by partnering with organizations to provide critical support, foster awareness, and pilot funding initiatives. Our ultimate goal is to empower mothers to overcome addiction, rebuild relationships with their families, and live meaningful, purpose-driven lives.",

    "summary": "What if you had a client acquisition system that consistently attracted, nurtured, and converted leads—without relying on referrals—allowing you to focus entirely on coaching? Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business.

    "summary": "I started my career in merchant and investment banking. It was fast-paced and deal-driven, and I gained exposure to complex financial structures early on. But what always captured my attention wasn’t the capital side — it was the operators. I was drawn to the builders, the entrepreneurs, the people in the trenches scaling something real. After working with several early-stage companies and briefly helping launch a hedge fund, I realized I loved the rhythm of small business — but I needed more than passion; I needed process. A chance meeting with a seasoned fractional CFO and a copy of Traction by Gino Wickman opened my eyes. Finally, there was a framework that matched my instinct. In 2021, I joined a local firm in a junior CFO role. What began as a stepping stone quickly became a proving ground. I helped grow the client base, built internal systems, and took on leadership early. But like many entrepreneurial stories, what I helped build wasn’t mine to own. While at that firm, I met Chris Gauvin — a Canadian, a CPA with a background in consulting and corporate finance. We couldn’t have had more different career paths. I came up through startups, Oklahoma State undergrad, and Dallas finance circles. He came through structured enterprise environments and had an MBA from the University of Texas. But we were in the same stage of life — married, kids the same ages, both driven to build something lasting. That common ground — vision, values, and a desire to finally have ownership in what we were building — led us to launch Local Fractional. We built it for the founders we wish we’d served better before: the ones who need more than bookkeeping and backwards-looking reports. We offer nearshore-powered accounting foundations paired with strategic, fractional CFO leadership. We help you understand where you are AND where you’re going. We deliver monthly reports, KPI analysis, and forward-looking financial strategy — but we don’t stop there. We’re building strategic AI tools that give founders 24/7 insight at their fingertips, because your best ideas don’t always come between 9 and 5. If you’re a founder building something real, we’d love to support your journey. -- If you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far go together --",

I’ve led culture transformations that have taken organizations from fractured to focused, from toxic to thriving, and from stagnant to scalable. My approach blends data-driven strategy with human-centered leadership because you can’t drive performance without first rebuilding trust. Throughout my career, I’ve been the leader called in to fix what’s broken and rebuild what’s possible. 🔹 At a Fortune 500 Company, I inherited the lowest-performing site in the nation — morale was low, turnover was high, and customer satisfaction was just 18%. Eighteen months later, we achieved 92% satisfaction and cut cycle times from 44 days to 18, outperforming the national average. 🔹 At a private sector company, I built HR infrastructure across eight business units, increasing retention by 35%, productivity by 25%, and reducing benefit costs by 15% — while maintaining 100% audit success. Those outcomes weren’t luck — they came from leadership grounded in three guiding principles: 1️⃣ Listen beyond the words — every voice matters. 2️⃣ Lead with strategy and heart — culture is both compass and engine. 3️⃣ Leave people better than you found them. I’m a People Watcher. A Culture Architect. A Hope Giver. I lead with compassion and excellence — helping executives align business strategy with human potential to drive engagement, retention, and measurable organizational performance. As your next Chief Human Resources Officer or People Culture Executive, I will: 👉 Transform culture into a measurable competitive advantage 👉 Build scalable systems that elevate growth, retention, and accountability 👉 Coach leaders to inspire, not just instruct 👉 Turn your workforce into a unified, purpose-driven community If you’re seeking a leader who can rebuild trust, re-energize teams, and deliver measurable results — let’s connect.

Execution slows, not from effort, but from Leadership Operating System mismatch. As organizations grow, priorities shift faster, decisions become interdependent, and coordination costs rise. Strong leaders work harder, but results don’t compound the way they used to. This is rarely a performance issue. It’s a Leadership Operating System issue. I work with leaders and executive teams to identify where leadership systems built for more stable conditions are breaking under complexity and how to evolve them so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience. My work focuses on upgrading how leaders think, decide, and operate together when scale, uncertainty, and pressure increase. Leadership Operating System Upgrades I Focus On • Escaping the Expert Trap Shifting from individual problem-solving to system-level leadership and decision architecture • Strategic Alignment Architecture Reducing decision latency and coordination friction across functions, teams, and stakeholders • Business Value Translation Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not burnout or heroics Background I bring 20+ years of experience working across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, supporting leadership and organizational reinvention in complex, global environments.

Every new hire or process adds complexity, not clarity. That’s where I come in. I help Visionaries like you build real businesses, not high-paying jobs. As a Fractional Integrator and COO, I step in as your Second-in-Command. I bring structure to the chaos, create clarity around roles, and build systems that keep your team moving forward without constant input from you. I’ve spent 25+ years doing this across industries: tech, telecom, construction, service, distribution, and several others. I’ve led teams as an VP of Operations, Integrator, President, and COO. Today, I work with companies between $2M and $50M who are scaling fast and feeling the pressure. Most are running on EOS® and have an Implementer™ or graduated from one. Here’s how we work together: 1. Clarify the structure – Clarify your Accountability Chart so everyone knows who owns what. 2. Install discipline – Use tools like scorecards, Rocks, and Meeting Rhythms that actually get traction. 3. Free you to lead – Remove you from day-to-day ops so you can stay in your zone of genius. When the right operational structure is in place, everything changes. You get your time back. Your team gets aligned. And your business becomes something you can grow, scale, or even sell.

I work seamlessly with Implementers and help drive EOS® through the organization not just at the leadership team level. Not on EOS® yet? I bring proven operational systems from warehousing, telecom, tech, SaaS, and production to help you build a business you can run, not one that runs you. Already have an Integrator or COO?

I work across four key areas to help leaders thrive: 🔹 Organizational Consulting – helping companies grow their leadership bench, engage high-potential talent, and build cultures where people and performance thrive. 🔹 Leadership Programs – designing and delivering transformative learning experiences that fuel clarity, confidence, and character. 🔹 Executive Coaching – serving as a strategic thinking partner to leaders navigating growth, change, and complexity - with empathy, candor, and results. 🔹 Peer Groups – facilitating curated, high-trust spaces for leaders to reflect, challenge assumptions, and accelerate their growth together. Because I believe leadership starts early, I also founded superpowHER - a leadership experience for young girls that helps them find their voice, build confidence, and embrace their unique strengths. Soon, we’re expanding with superpowHIM, because every young person deserves the tools to lead with character and courage. At the heart of my work is a core belief: leadership isn’t a title, it’s an expression of identity. When people lead from who they truly are, their impact becomes magnetic - purpose-driven, values-led, and impossible to ignore.

That experience is the foundation of our work today. How We Won partners with organizations to help their people and teams in high-stakes, dynamic environments become totally unshakeable. Our founder’s journey started during her recovery when she discovered a passion for the human side of performance. This led her to journalism, covering the inner workings of Major League Baseball player development for NPR. Being on the ground gave Kim a deep understanding of the complexity, ambiguity and risk that leaders and staff in pro sports and entertainment face every day. Now, we serve as the long-term strategic partner to talent at organizations in the most demanding industries, helping them build the personal and team resiliency to create winning leadership and cultures. We’ve delivered over 4,500 sessions to employees at top companies like Google, American Express and Warner Bros. Discovery. Kim is an ICF Professional Certified Coach (PCC), Master Certified Coach (MCC) applicant, and QE Executive Certified Coach (ECC. She also holds a B.S. in Psychology and believes an individual's personal strength and health are the most important drivers of an organization’s success. “Kim is more than a coach. She's a strategic partner. She has a unique ability to help you peel back the layers of complex, multi-faceted challenges until you find the core issue. I went into our work feeling overwhelmed and left with a profound sense of clarity and peace. She doesn't just help you solve problems. She helps you see that you were never broken to begin with.” - VP, Global Partnerships at a Fortune 100 Company Our services are optimized for organizational needs and include: Trainings, Workshops, and Coaching (Executive, Team, Leadership, Onboarding, Career Path, and Shadowing).",

I partner closely with executives, HR leaders, and managers to strengthen the everyday moments that define leadership: setting direction, giving feedback, navigating ambiguity, and supporting people through change. Through FutureForm, I work with leaders and teams to develop three timeless leadership capabilities: Clarity - Helping leaders focus on what matters most and communicate it so teams can move with confidence. Connection - Building trust, psychological safety, and real understanding between leaders and their teams. Confidence - Supporting leaders to lead with steadiness, humility, and authenticity, without relying on control. Career clarity is a core part of this work. When leaders and employees understand their strengths, values, and direction, performance improves, engagement deepens, and retention follows. Clarity at the individual level strengthens leadership at the organizational level.

But I had to make a living, so I founded a marketing agency. I worked with B2B service businesses, and promised them what everyone does. More marketing means: - More leads - More clients - More revenue Long story short, that didn't happen. I wasn't getting results because my approach was wrong. I noticed: Like most businesses, when B2B service firms want more clients, they invest in marketing. They chase cold leads, lose a ton of money, and wonder why nothing's working. So rather than being yet another run-of-the-mill marketing agency, I pivoted. Now, I build infrastructure to get more referrals. Why? It's the cheapest, fastest, and most effective way for a B2B service firm to grow. WHAT I BUILD: Referable Brand → Positioning and messaging so clients know exactly who to refer to you Validation-Ready Digital Presence → Website and LinkedIn optimized for referral confidence, not SEO traffic Relationship CRM → Automated touchpoints that keep your network warm and generate systematic referrals WHO THIS IS FOR: Established B2B service firms ($500K-$5M) with 20+ client relationships but no system to leverage them. Consulting firms, agencies, coaches. WHY REFERRALS ARE BETTER: - They convert 71% higher than paid leads - They close 69% faster - Retention rates are 37% higher You might worry about being dependent on referrals. Odds are, you're not dependent ENOUGH. I've built infrastructure for 20+ clients in the past year—creative agencies, solo consultants, coaches, EOS implementers, even a catering company.

Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you. Let’s build something that lasts.",

My summary used to be the same-old rote descriptions of all the things I thought I was. It included words like \"strategic\", \"collaborator\", \"leadership-driven\", \"people-centric\", and so on… I AM all those things but what about the PERSON behind the ROLE? Where did she go, I wonder? Well, a COMPLETE burnout in HR during the pandemic and two, yes two, subsequent layoffs in two years, I'm finally free of the constraints our modern workplace norms have become. I would now describe myself as a former Human Resource professional who woke up one day and had enough of the games, the politicking, working the grind for someone else only to be a cog in the wheel. It became untenable. I was reminded that we really can only control the \"controllables\"... ... how we respond to change, the integrity with which we handle ourselves, how we manage our home & finances, how we take care of and love those who we love, and ultimately where/when/how we steward the gifts and time we've been given. Jobs will come and go but who you are in the in-between matters most. I recently read a famous quote that made my stomach turn and my pulse race ...\"The majority of people die at 35 but aren't buried until 75\" - I see what this represents all around me and have my whole career. People on autopilot, no self-reflecting, not thriving, not clear on their God-given purpose and direction. I believe God wants better for you and for me.

CONTACT ME for a complimentary consultation at 216.333.4569 or Kelly@LawrenceInnovation.com. I'm the one people call to deliver new business growth. With over 20 years of experience spanning Fortune 500 companies, privately held businesses, and startups, I'm grateful to have partnered with global leaders and coached hundreds of team members to drive top and bottom-line growth while unlocking new business opportunities: strategy to execution. I strive for continuous learning, so it's an honor to serve as a contributing author to WhatTheyThink, an AIM Institute coach and Innoquest community member. I've enjoyed the learning that has come from authoring globally recognized market reports and working with global teams over the years. I am thrilled to share insights with others who share the vision of improving organic growth processes and results. When you choose to work with me, you gain a partner who cares about growing your business just as much as you do.

ORGANIC GROWTH EXPERTISE From initial market assessment through demand creation, I help you analyze your unique situation and develop practical action plans to accelerate organic growth. I also help teams build stronger competency in front-end-of innovation processes for higher hit rates. Before founding Lawrence Innovation, I delivered impactful innovation results at Fortune Brands' Moen and Berkshire Hathaway's Lubrizol. My teams typically have a hit rate upwards of 60% versus industry averages of under 5%. What would it do for you if you could improve your hit rate by 10x? MY VISION Walt Disney said, \"If you dream it, you can do it.\" I say, of course you can, but make sure it matters to your customers before you build it. MAKING IT MATTER Passionate about making the world a better place, I live and play in Greater Cleveland, Ohio with my husband and two daughters - my why. I relish learning new things. Hobbies include traveling, standup paddle boarding, hiking with my pal Zeke (English Black Labrador), baking, & reading.",

I work with professional service firms, consumer product brands, manufacturing businesses, construction companies, and technology firms to develop and implement actionable strategies that fuel revenue growth, enhance profitability, and build high-performing teams. WHY MY EXPERIENCE MATTERS TO YOUR BUSINESS: I spent my career leading marketing, sales, and business development for well-known consumer brands and manufacturing firms. While my expertise began in consumer-driven industries, the principles of growth, positioning, and strategy apply universally and are just as critical for professional service firms as they are for consumer brands. Professional service firms struggle with differentiation, client acquisition, and scaling. Consumer brands focus on creating emotional connections, brand loyalty, and effective go-to-market strategies. My expertise blends both, helping professional service firms apply consumer-driven insights to win more business while guiding consumer brands to develop lasting market impact. HOW I HELP: ✔ Growth Strategy & Positioning – Establishing a compelling market position that drives demand and revenue. ✔ Leadership & Team Optimization – Helping owners develop leadership skills, structure strong teams, and build a results-driven culture. ✔ Sales & Marketing Acceleration – Driving lead generation, conversion, and long-term customer engagement. ✔ Business Efficiency & Financial Strategy – Identifying key operational efficiencies to improve profitability and scale effectively. ✔ Exit & Transition Planning – Preparing businesses for leadership transitions, mergers, or sales to maximize value. REAL RESULTS, REAL IMPACT: ✅ Transformed professional service firms by refining messaging, improving operations, and increasing client acquisition. ✅ Led go-to-market strategies that drove multimillion-dollar growth for national and global consumer brands. ✅ Revitalized declining industries through strategic branding and marketing that increased market share and profitability. ✅ Helped business owners scale and exit by positioning their companies for sustainable growth and maximum valuation.

I help leaders and organizations create a culture of inclusion and psychological safety where innovation thrives. My master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling informs my holistic, research-backed coaching framework. Together, we explore new perspectives and identify solutions for growth and success as well as health and well-being. In 1998, I moved from my native Finland to New York City. I was the first in my family to earn a college degree and, like many others, I craved the energy, inspiration, and diversity of life in NYC. I held career services and HR & development roles before founding my independent coaching practice. My expertise lies in international and highly-demanding professional contexts—since founding my practice, my work has taken me to Helsinki, Rome, Bangkok, and Bonn and I’ve worked with leaders based across six continents. Sisu—the Finnish concept of resilience—and my own personal experiences as an immigrant have deeply influenced my coaching philosophy. My approach to coaching is built upon a core belief in our human capacity to learn and grow, to succeed through challenges, and live and lead with purpose. Alongside my coaching practice, I am an experienced senior non-profit founder and board leader. I have founded, led, and developed several global and local non-profit community organizations over the past 30 years. After I moved to NYC, I founded two non-profit organizations with and for Nordic women. I have served as vice-president for a global non-profit FIGT.org, and the local Finnish American Chamber of Commerce in NYC. I led the Chatham High School Marching Band Club, a registered 501c3, as President for several years. As a leader, I am driven by my values to make a difference by strengthening communities through engagement. In all my leadership experiences, I have improved the performance and structure of the board—I am a skilled organizer known for getting things done. I lead with a strong vision and clear goals while building engagement and motivation through communication and relationship building.

    "summary": "Most professional-services firms lose 10 to 25 percent of their margin to collaboration failures they can’t see — not talent gaps, but system design flaws that quietly erode profitability, slow execution, and overload high performers. I am an Execution Risk Diagnostics & Advisory for Professional Services Firms and founder of CollabIntel™ Consulting Group. I work with senior executives responsible for operational performance, profitability, and cross-functional execution in midsize professional-services firms. My work starts where traditional consulting stops: exposing the structural breakdowns inside the People OS, Team OS, and Execution OS that create rework, stalled decisions, uneven delivery, and operational drag. Using diagnostic-driven operating models, I quantify the financial cost of misalignment and redesign the collaboration architecture so firms move faster, deliver consistently, and protect margin under pressure — without relying on heroics or a handful of overloaded contributors. I also created CollabCode™, a structural methodology and certification pathway for practitioners who want to build and sustain collaboration as an operating discipline. Not personality. Not chemistry. Infrastructure. If your firm is facing rising rework, slow decisions, uneven client delivery, or increasing compensation costs for system gaps, the issue isn’t performance — it’s architecture. And architecture can be rebuilt. HOW TO WORK WITH ME CollabIntel™ Consulting Group Diagnostic → System Redesign → Implementation Support For executive teams that need collaboration to hold under pressure and scale with growth. CollabCode™ Ecosystem Frameworks → Tools → Methodology → Certification For practitioners operationalizing collaboration with real structure. Speaking & Advisory Topics include collaborative intelligence, operating system design, cross-functional execution, and the role of AI in future-of-work performance.

Organizations come to CollabIntel when coordination feels harder than it should—when decisions stall, communication breaks under pressure, handoffs fall apart, and leaders are forced to compensate for system weaknesses. These issues rarely show up as one major failure. They accumulate quietly as Collaboration Tax: the hidden financial cost of work that does not move cleanly across teams. Our proprietary diagnostic process surfaces where collaboration is breaking down inside real operating environments. We identify the points where clarity, accountability, execution flow, and cross-functional alignment are failing—and why. From there, we design system-level solutions that strengthen how work moves through the organization. Our approach is infrastructure-based, not personality-based. We focus on the operating system behind execution reliability. Our Work Centers On: • Collaboration diagnostics • Human operating systems • Execution flow and decision pathways • Accountability structures • Cross-functional alignment • Collaboration Tax reduction The result is measurable improvement in delivery efficiency, margin stability, and leadership bandwidth.

Over a 27-year career at Prudential Financial, I held senior leadership roles across Information Technology and led the company’s Office of Veterans Initiatives for 8 years. There, I built and scaled nationally recognized programs supporting veteran and military spouse employment, financial wellness, and community reintegration—earning top honors from ESGR, Hiring Our Heroes, and Military Times. Before my corporate career, I graduated in the top 10% of my class from the United States Military Academy at West Point and then served as a United States Army Infantry Officer. I later earned my MBA, and continue to build on that foundation as a Maxwell Leadership Certified Coach, Speaker, Trainer, and DISC Consultant—leveraging the DISC behavioral assessment tool to enhance communication, collaboration, and leadership effectiveness. I also broadened my leadership experience and exposure as 2021 George W Bush Presidential Center Veteran Leadership Program Scholar. Today, I serve as President & Founder of JB Strategic Solutions, where I help individuals and organizations solve challenges through leadership coaching, behavioral insights, and mission-aligned strategy. I’m also active in national mentoring and advocacy efforts through Hiring Our Heroes, NPower, American Corporate Partnership, and the SHRM Foundation’s Military Community Advisory Committee – all with a focus on helping veterans and military families achieve meaningful employment and financial security. Recently I have become involved with Leaderly AI, a continuous learning & engagement platform that uses microlearning to allow leaders to grow and develop at the pace of life.

    "summary": "Most organizations are drowning in tools they don't need, solving for problems they haven't defined. I help small businesses and nonprofits get aligned before AI, build structure before scale, and create systems that serve people—not the other way around. THE PROBLEM Leaders buy systems before documenting their sales process. They buy automation before clarifying workflow. They chase AI before knowing what problems they're solving. Result? Expensive technology that creates chaos, not clarity. The tech industry profits from this confusion. I don't. ALIGNED BEFORE AI I published a book by this title because I'm tired of watching businesses waste money on premature technology. CLARITY BEFORE COMPLEXITY – Before tools, we clarify what you're trying to accomplish. Until you can articulate this, no software will save you. STRUCTURE BEFORE SCALE – You cannot automate chaos. If processes are broken, AI breaks them faster. We build documented workflows first, then introduce technology. HUMANS BEFORE HYPE – AI amplifies what exists. Confused teams get more confused. Aligned teams become force multipliers. WHAT I'VE BUILT As Founder of Align & Innovate, I provide fractional Chief AI & Systems Officer services to organizations needing strategic technology leadership. Before that, I co-founded Visuals by Momo, helping 50+ nonprofits tell emotionally resonant stories through documentary productions. That taught me: the best technology means nothing if you can't tell a coherent story about what you do. I bring that lens to systems work. Every CRM, every workflow, every AI strategy—it's storytelling. I also host Visual Eyes Podcast, exploring storytelling, technology, and community impact. WHO I WORK WITH Leaders tired of tools that promise transformation but deliver headaches. Leaders ready to invest in foundational systems instead of chasing shiny objects. What I don't do: Sell software you don't need. Build AI that impresses investors but confuses teams. What I do: Ask hard questions. Design systems that reduce friction. Train teams to own tools—not be owned by them. MY CREDENTIALS • AI+ Chief AI Officer Certified • Board of Directors, HandsOn South Florida • Author: \"Aligned Before AI\" (Amazon, 2025) • Co-Founder, Visuals by Momo I don't sell what you don't need.

Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” — Margaret Mead, American Anthropologist The impact of climate change is seen and felt all around us.

The World Bank estimates that 40 percent of the global population lives in places of high vulnerability to climate change. \"Business as usual\" investing could put asset owners at risk of not meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, being misaligned with rapidly evolving regulations/guidelines or simply being out of touch with their stakeholders’ sustainability convictions.

My edge? 15 years building brands across industries most people think have nothing in common: healthcare, college athletics and the home services industry. Turns out, the frameworks that work aren't industry-specific. They're builder-specific. Here's what I've learned: The best brands don't just look good. They feel right. They create resonance, not just reach. The best systems don't just work once. They scale across contexts. What fixes patient experience also fixes customer acquisition. The best leaders don't choose between growth and sanity. They refuse to sacrifice soul for systems. What I focus on: → Brand strategy that creates connection (not just content) → Cross-industry frameworks that actually scale → AI-powered systems that amplify (not replace) strategic thinking → AEO strategies so businesses get discovered when AI agents do research → Energy management for leaders who ship consistently without burning out Currently: Brand strategist/consultant helping companies bridge the gap between brand promise and customer reality. Building to be the AI-era marketing strategist, experimenting with AI tools that help builders ship faster without losing their voice or burning out their best ideas. The shift happening right now: Search is evolving from rankings to citations. Local businesses need to be mentioned when ChatGPT recommends solutions, not just found on Google.

    "summary": "I help owner-led businesses scale without burnout by fixing three things: capacity, visibility, and referral-driven growth. When growth stalls, it’s rarely a talent issue. It’s usually a bottleneck, unclear execution, or a visibility gap. I’m a Business Growth Strategist and growth partner to small to mid-size business owners who want to lead like the CEO of their business, not the busiest employee in it. What I do: 1) Capacity (Delegation + Virtual Professionals) I start with a time and workflow audit, then design the proper role and outcomes. Through my Gentask alliance, I can connect you with vetted virtual professionals once the role is clear. Visibility (Free Visibility Audit + SEO strategy): If you’re not getting the leads you should from Google, or you’re paying for marketing but can’t clearly verify outcomes, I’ll run a free visibility (SEO) audit and show you what’s working, what’s missing, and what to fix first. After the audit, if you decide you want to move forward, I will remain as your strategy and accountability lead, my proven SEO implementation team executes the optimization work, and I review the reporting with you, translate what it means, and adjust priorities month-to-month. 3) Referrals (The Power Connectors™) I build referral-first ecosystems where business owners create warm introductions, strategic partnerships, and real deal flow.

    "summary": "Con más de 24 años liderando estrategias de marca, comunicación y relaciones públicas —principalmente en el sector financiero— he vivido en carne propia las brechas, silencios y techos que enfrentan las mujeres en el mundo corporativo. Por eso fundé Estimada Rebel, no como un proyecto más, sino como un movimiento para rediseñar el lugar que ocupamos las mujeres en las empresas: con poder, propósito y autonomía. Hoy, como CEO de Estimada Rebel, diseño e implemento programas de alto impacto como Confident Rebel y Rebel Leader, además de asesorar a organizaciones que buscan transformar sus culturas hacia un liderazgo más inclusivo. A través de nuestro enfoque estratégico, miles de mujeres han fortalecido su confianza, aprendido a comunicar su valor y avanzado hacia puestos de liderazgo con visión, ambición y sin culpa. Mi carrera comenzó mucho antes de emprender. He liderado equipos en GBM, la institución financiera independiente más grande de México, RIU Hotels & Resorts y el British Council, enfrentando de cerca los desafíos de crecer profesionalmente en estructuras donde las decisiones se toman —aún hoy— sin mujeres en la mesa. Esa experiencia no solo afiló mi mirada estratégica, sino que encendió mi convicción: no basta con abrir espacio, hay que preparar a más mujeres para ocuparlo con claridad, autoridad y resultados. Mi formación como Business Coach certificada por Newfield Consulting, bajo la metodología de Rafael Echeverría, y mi especialización en Liderazgo Femenino por Harvard Business School, respaldan una propuesta que integra desarrollo personal, confianza profesional y visión de negocio. Lo que ofrecemos en Estimada Rebel no es inspiración vacía: es estrategia aplicada para mujeres decididas a liderar. Creo firmemente que el talento femenino está listo para ocupar el centro de la conversación empresarial. Mi misión es asegurar que también esté listo para liderarla.",

    "summary": "I’ve spent my entire career inside HR. But the people I care about most aren’t sitting in corporate boardrooms. They’re running skilled trades and service businesses. They’re out in the field early, managing crews, juggling schedules, solving problems in real time — and doing everything they can to keep the work moving and their people supported. And almost every one of them has said some version of the same thing to me: “I know HR matters… I just don’t have the time. And honestly, I’m not even sure where to start.” That’s exactly why I founded On Demand HR Solutions. Small, growing trades businesses don’t need corporate HR theory or overbuilt policies that don’t fit how the work actually gets done. They need simple, practical HR support — delivered in a way that works alongside the business, not on top of it. That’s where I come in. I work as an independent on-demand HR partner for skilled trades businesses, and I offer a few clear ways to get support, depending on what you need right now: HR SOS Session A focused, one-hour working session to tackle one specific HR issue — a people problem, compliance question, hiring concern, or “this just came up and I need help” situation. HR Blueprint A short-term, hands-on engagement to put the HR foundations in place — clear policies, better hiring and onboarding, and simple systems that bring structure and consistency to how you manage your crew. HR Advisory Ongoing HR support for owners who want a trusted partner in their corner — someone they can call, message, or loop in when questions come up, decisions need to be made, or issues start to surface. No over-engineered solutions. No corporate speak. No judgment. Just honest, practical HR support designed for businesses where the work happens in the field. I believe HR should make running a business easier — not harder. If you’re not sure which option makes sense, that’s okay. Most people aren’t. Send me a message here on LinkedIn and tell me what’s going on. I’ll help you figure out the simplest next step. 📥 Message me on LinkedIn — I’m just one DM away.",

    "job_description": "After more than 30 years leading HR in complex corporate environments, I started noticing a pattern. Small, growing skilled trades businesses were being asked to manage the same HR responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, safety, compliance, employee issues — without the time, support, or internal HR teams that larger companies rely on. Most owners don't want to “do HR.” They just wanted the work to run smoothly, their crews supported, and their business protected. So I founded On Demand HR Solutions to meet them where they are. Today, I work as an on-demand HR partner for skilled trades and field-based businesses, helping owners put practical HR systems in place that actually work in real life. My focus is HR operations and people management that supports how trades businesses run day to day. That includes everything from hiring and onboarding crews, to setting clear expectations, handling employee issues, and staying compliant as the business grows. I step in where HR usually falls through the cracks and help bring structure, clarity, and consistency without overcomplicating things. What this looks like in practice: - Acting as the HR department for small trades businesses, providing on-demand guidance, HR administration, and compliance support - Supporting owners through sensitive employee relations issues with a balance of compassion, clarity, and compliance - Building right-sized HR foundations — handbooks, policies, onboarding processes, and basic systems that crews can actually follow - Providing fractional or interim HR support when a business needs experienced HR leadership without hiring full-time - Helping owners move from reactive, day-to-day people issues to more stable, repeatable ways of managing their teams This work allows me to do what I care about most: Making HR feel manageable for business owners who already have enough on their plates — and helping trades businesses grow without the constant stress of “figuring it out as they go.”",

    "previous_job_description": "While my title at Integra LifeSciences changed over 16 years, the constant was transformation. Integra’s growth-by-acquisition strategy meant the business—and HR—were always evolving. Every acquisition brought new people, systems, and challenges, giving me the opportunity to reinvent HR over and over again. It often felt like working for a dozen companies within one. In my final role as Head of Global HR Service Delivery, I built and led what became the one-stop-shop for employee support across payroll, benefits, onboarding, leave of absence, employee relations and more. I launched ServiceNow globally, to streamline employee inquiries, reducing response times to under 24 hours, and creating a single source of truth for HR processes. This work supported a dynamic, fast-scaling organization where clear, efficient HR processes were critical. But beyond the systems and processes, what I’m most proud of is how we made HR approachable again—turning a fragmented, confusing experience into one where employees felt supported and leaders had the tools they needed to lead confidently. Earlier, as Head of HR for Corporate Functions, I served as the executive HR partner to C-Suite Finance, IT, Legal, Business Development, and Scientific leaders—supporting them through organization design, restructuring, and workforce planning. I helped leaders build talent strategies, navigate organizational changes, and integrate acquired teams seamlessly into the business. As HR Manager, I supported global operations, quality, regulatory, and commercial sales teams, leading recruitment and retention strategies, launching training programs, and guiding leaders through performance management and employee relations issues. Integra was where I learned to thrive in ambiguity, manage change without losing sight of people, and ensure HR always aligned with the evolving needs of the business.",
