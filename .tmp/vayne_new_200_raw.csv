Whether it was identifying problems when no one else was looking, asking the probing questions that every parent dreads, or offering solutions—sometimes unsolicited—I was always driven to make things better. If you had asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answers would have included lawyer, police officer, or doctor. As I got older, I knew those weren't right for me. My career journey has taken me through various sectors, including small to medium-sized businesses, the service industry, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C., a mega-church, and local government. In each organization, I consistently sought to understand the challenges at hand. I asked questions, identified issues, and proposed solutions—some welcomed, others less so. Regardless of the setting, my focus remained on finding the most strategic and logical paths forward. This involved refining existing processes and systems. One recurring theme across all these organizations was a lack of clarity in management and leadership. Employees often struggled with unclear expectations, resulting in low morale and plenty of “water cooler” conversations post-meetings. Furthermore, genuine people development was frequently overlooked. Through my diverse work experiences and education, I discovered the sweet spot where my skills and passions intersected. Today, I have the privilege of helping businesses transform their operations and cultures. I collaborate closely with business owners to diagnose their challenges and craft tailored growth strategies. The best part? They define what success looks like for them, and together we build a roadmap to achieve it. Are You Facing These Challenges? ⏩ Is your business growing but you're unsure how to sustain that momentum? ⏩ Is your team not performing at the level you know they can? ⏩ Are you bogged down by a lack of clarity and ineffective processes that hinder your growth? ⏩ Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed as a business owner or CEO and longing for more balance in your life? If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, I want to invite you into a conversation. This initial conversation will help us diagnose the issues within your business and identify actionable strategies you can implement right away.

Women served on some committees but, were not allowed to hold office and did not have voting privileges. Because women were paid lower salaries in those days, most women could not afford to join the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1950, that all changed. Martha McKinley received permission from the President of the Chamber to form a “Women’s Section”, with dues more affordable to the working women of that time. They were to have their own Officers and Bylaws. For the next 40 years, the Women’s Section acted as a support group for the Chamber. In 1990 it was time for a change and thus evolved the Fresno County Women’s Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) organization.

Maybe you’ve heard these phrases from your own boss: “Well, I’m the boss so I’m going to do what I want.” “I’m the boss and get to make the final decision.” “This is how it’s going to be done—no questions.” If those words sound familiar, then realize that you’re not alone.

Established in 1965, the college first opened its doors to students in the fall of 1966. Since that time, the JC has become a leader in innovative educational programs, dual credit education for area high school students, industrial and professional workforce training, and a critical player in the economy of the region. Situated on 219 acres, the college has over 637,000 gross square feet of building space with an enrollment of about 3,000 students. Students can receive an Associates of Arts, and Associates of Science, and an Associates of Applied Science, with an emphasis in several fields, plus we offer occupational certificate programs that provide a course of study preparing students directly for employment or self-employment upon completion of the program. Long a leader in dual credit education, well before the term was widely recognized, NMJC and area high schools have evolved a best practice model of dual credit and on campus career technical training courses that regularly results in high school seniors walking for their high school diploma and two-year degree in the same week. As an early adopter of distance education technology, NMJC provides a wide range of educational opportunities to students throughout the region and nation. Roughly one-third of NMJC student credit hours are produced in an online-learning environment. In workforce training and professional development, The JC provided more workforce training in 2014 for area residents and businesses than any other community college in New Mexico, despite the fact that its rural area is significantly smaller than the large metropolitan areas of the state. NMJC is a national leader in energy education and training. Serving an area of the country known as the Permian Basin, The JC has developed one of the first comprehensive oil field training facilities in the nation. In addition, the recent expansion of the nuclear industry in the region has driven development of a robust online training program for nuclear technicians. With support from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Lockheed Martin, The JC has become the college-of-choice for technical training in the nuclear industry. Annually, students in the nursing program at NMJC are ranked in the top ten percent of all nursing students in the nation, based on their national testing scores. The NMJC Law Enforcement Academy has been ranked one of the premiere academies in the state. Its instructors are in demand to help police departments throughout New Mexico with updated training for their forces. The NMJC Foundation has awarded over $2.5 million in scholarships and work-study assistance to NMJC students. Another $560,000 has funded program support for students and faculty. The foundation manages over 75 different endowments, annual scholarships and program assistance funds totaling over $8 million. New Mexico Junior College is one of the few community colleges in New Mexico with athletic programs. Student-athletes typically maintain high GPAs while competing. All six of the athletic programs earned post-season berths in either regional or national competitions. NMJC is a full-service institution with student housing, athletics and an aggressive range of traditional, transfer educational offerings. The University Center houses four-year and graduate programs allowing students to move from Day One of their college experience through Bachelors and Masters level programs without leaving campus.",17317,"John Maxwell Leadership Trainer, Speaker and Coach"

I was surrounded by leaders in the wrong positions and people in positions of authority who had no business being there. I want to give people who are considering leadership, those in leadership who are struggling, and executives who are over their heads an opportunity to develop before they hurt someone or themselves.

Over the past 30 years, I have held numerous executive advisor and senior positions while serving in the United States Navy and civilian sector. Through education and training, I helped strengthen the chain of command and businesses, providing sound decision support and creating open communication at all levels. I also helped formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, and training of Navy and civilian personnel. My performance won me the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. I was named 2013, 2014, and 2017 Mentor of the Year, and recipient of the inaugural 2014 Chief John Dungan Jr. Oceanographer of the Navy Award.

Our clients trust us and rely on us that we lead their employees and their teams to more success across national and cultural borders. We assist in improving business success by providing a variety of services which are targeted at and tailored to increasing productivity when entering new international markets. When companies work internationally and expand outside of their home markets, their employees need to be effective in collaborating with people from cultures which are foreign to them. They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences. Beyond language barriers global professionals are confronted with different behaviors and ways of doing business. Failing to communicate, manage, inspire, and lead across cultural differences is a huge risk for these companies, and the lack of cultural competence can be a bottom-line relevant issue. We help multinational organizations and their employees to work better together across cultures. In an international context, smart business decisions depend on the ability to bridge cultural differences. Employees on every level of the organization need to be able to understand these differences and how to work across cultures. When global leaders fail to adjust and to operate in light of cultural differences, international projects are at risk: Companies lose business due to miscommunication and miss out on international growth opportunities.

There’s a reason CEO's call me an ""M&A Whisperer"". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the ""unexpected people challenges"" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, ""NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions"" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc.

true,true,urn:li:member:1270637,Daniel,Sweet,dsweet@sweetviewpartners.com,,"I'm not an exit consultant. I help owners build businesses they never want to sell. (Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: ""I can't take a real vacation without chaos"" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: ""I need to scale but organic growth is too slow"" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: ""I want options but don't know where to start"" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: ""It's time. Get me the best outcome possible"" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison. Multiple options = freedom. 📊 Find out where you stand: Send me a message and let's talk about where you are and where you want to be. 📚 Or start with my book: ""Unlocking Small Business Value"" The playbook I wish I'd had for my first acquisition: https://grw.bz/unlock P.S.

Do you find your team stuck in old patterns, rehashing past challenges instead of moving towards a more generative future? As a social entrepreneur, are you struggling to align your deep values with your daily actions, and find a clear path to making the impact you desire? At Heyman Partners, we understand these challenges. We help leaders, social entrepreneurs, and creative professionals move past these obstacles to achieve impact with joy through integrated growth and aligned purpose. We guide individuals and organizations to the sweet spot where they can make a real difference while maintaining a deep sense of fulfillment. I've worked with many leaders who, while managing people and resources, guiding strategy and implementation, and confronting disagreement, sometimes neglect their own internal boundaries, leading to overwhelm and burnout. I've also learned that while occasionally rehashing ""war stories"" can be instructive, focusing on those times can keep you and your team stuck in the past, rather than moving towards a generative future. In my work, I help my clients learn to develop healthy boundaries, shift away from trauma bonds, and move forward with generative energy. Here’s what some of my clients say: “I threw out a number of goals and within 20 minutes we had compelling and inspiring direction.” “She has twice lead out team in decision making that enabled us to thrive and grow as an organization.” “She could cut to the heart of an issue and help us find our way there, and also a path forward.” Are you or your team ready to discover your sweet spot where impact and joy intersect?

true,false,urn:li:member:43862,Alex,Nesbitt,,,"I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

false,false,urn:li:member:1641442,Ken yager,"Ctp, mba",,,"WHAT I DO: For more than 35 years and over 600 engagements, I have rapidly helped companies with revenue $5MM to $50MM fix their cash flow and plan cash flow and operations changes for future profitability. Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher™. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME™) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME™ trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach™ program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)– because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME™ company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment – again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours. Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,620,000,000 in debt and saved 14,731 jobs. NEXT STEP: Can we help you? 800-306-1250 kyager@newpointadvisors.us www.newpointadvisors.us",Founder and President - Financial Advisors to Small Distressed Companies and Stakeholder,"WHY IT MATTERS: Cash flow is the life-blood of your business. When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher™ tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME™ helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME™ gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years. STATISTICS: Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,355,000,000 in debt and saved 13,414 jobs.

true,false,urn:li:member:12990742,Joanna,Kozlowski,,,"I work with smart, ambitious professionals and the organizations they lead — helping teams and leaders get unstuck, aligned, and ready to move when things feel complex or high-stakes. I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs. If you’re developing your leadership pipeline, planning a retreat, navigating change, or looking for a strategic facilitator and advisor — let’s talk. 📍 Based in DC, available nationwide 🔗 www.resoluteconsulting.co | joanna@resoluteconsulting.co | 301 873 9481",Founder & Principal Consultant,"I founded Resolute Consulting to build a practice where I could do the work I love (not manage others doing that work) and make a difference in the satisfaction and success of my clients. I partner with organizations to navigate complexity, align teams, and drive strategic growth. Leveraging a dual background in adult education and professional services leadership, I design and deliver programming that builds capacity, fosters connection, and delivers actionable outcomes. I do this through: • Learning & Development: Researching, writing, and delivering adult learning programs focused on emotional intelligence, communication skills, and strengths-based leadership. Building the non-technical skills for technical experts. • Strategic Advisory: Providing thought partnership for leaders, particularly those with technical-based career paths. • Program Design & Facilitation: Crafting and leading retreats, leadership development cohorts, and workshop series tailored to client needs. • Academic teaching and advising: Adjunct Professor and Faculty for curriculum grounded in career readiness. My sector expertise includes AEC, CRE, professional services firms, and associations. Through my role at Resolute, I have: • Facilitated over 100 learning sessions across various industries, consistently receiving high client satisfaction ratings. • Implemented leadership development programs resulting in measurable improvements in team performance and engagement. • Advised executive teams during organizational transitions, contributing to successful change management initiatives.

true,false,urn:li:member:17859649,Sandy,Lamb,,,"Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

The keys to sustainable success lie in objective examination of the mindset, decision making, culture, and measures of success that you think are working, but are holding you back from achieving your goals. Don’t celebrate an “ROI” where you’ve simply completed a project or covered project expenses…you are a leader(!); your growth metric is about changing the trajectory of growth…period. That’s the “Delta” that matters. Finally, Todd helps companies stop the inward focus of the Human Resources function, linear thinking about change, and ignoring growth limiting habits just to chase the next new thing. Execution matters! Drives adoption of innovative and evidence-based practices in leading change, coaching key leaders, and distilling the best leadership guidance into practical, easy-to-adopt keys to unlocking performance. Uses data and strategic insight to help leadership teams see into gaps which slow growth or result in change failures.

From a front row perspective, I’ve learned that founders have the hardest jobs with ever-expanding scope. This made me start my company. Founders need skilled generalists they can trust and rely on to support them and lead some of the varying demands of their roles. In the early stages of a business there are specific challenges that founders and their orgs face that I help with. 1. To align people, strategy and data, and run a rhythm that reflects this trajectory. 2. To communicate effectively with multiple stakeholders in and outside of the org. 3. To execute on high priority projects without a clear owner. I founded FlowCos, as a way to enhance founders' capabilities, ensuring they can focus on growth without compromising on operational efficiency. As a fractional professional, I give my best to each client and act with the full conviction that a full-time team member would.",Founder,"Founders of growing teams struggle with operational bottlenecks and lack time to align and communicate with their teams around strategic plans.

So I figured it out. Built things. Broke things. Built them better. >> What I learned: While the tech is (still) hard to wrap your head around, getting it to work as hoped and get the ROI you think it should comes from: 1. Understanding what AI can actually do (past the hype) 2. Finding the problems worth solving first 3. Building solutions people actually use >> Who I have helped: - Ops leaders at growth-stage startups - Founders building their first AI workflows for AI-first scaling - RevOps teams buried in manual work - Solopreneurs making AI useful for their business ...all spanning SaaS, talent & recruiting, real estate, non-profits, and more. >> The common thread? Pretty much the same thing every time. They see the AI opportunity. It's obvious something's there. But there's a gap between seeing it and actually using it. That's what I help close. >> How we work together: Learn (build your own capability): → Follow along here - I share what's actually working for me and others! → Subscribe to my newsletter - https://harrysiggins.substack.com/ → Courses - see featured section for cohorts! → Manual Override - an accelerator supporting solopreneurs and fractional execs in building AI-forward businesses (https://www.manualoverride.co/) Build (I work alongside you): → Consulting projects (agents, workflows, and training) → Retainers for ongoing build work and advisory >> What changes: You know what the before looks like. ! AI that seems impressive but doesn't apply to your work. ! A mental list of ""try this"" ideas that never go anywhere. ! Tools you've signed up for and stopped using. ! The feeling that everyone else figured this out already. That's the gap. Seeing the opportunity but not closing it. But once you do: * You know what AI can do for YOUR work in theory AND practice. * You have capability. Skills to do it yourself, systems I built with you, or both. * The next AI opportunity is easier to see and easier to act on because you've done it once now. * You're not someone who talks about AI anymore. You're someone who uses it. * You run an AI-first operation, team, and company. --- DM me or book a call: onetwogrowth.com",Principal & Founder,"Founded OneTwo Growth Studio to help companies operate AI-first.

That experience now shapes how I support leadership teams navigating transformation and uncertainty. Through Louise Dufresne Consultancy, I partner with senior leaders and their teams in industrial and operational sectors undergoing change — whether it’s restructuring, growth, realignment, or facing the ongoing effects of constant change, competing demands, and rising complexity. Clients often say I bring clarity where there’s complexity. I create space for meaningful conversations — calmly, with focus and without pressure. With a systemic lens, I help teams reconnect to what matters, reshape the way they collaborate, and regain sustainable momentum. What sets me apart is the balance I bring: • A practical, analytical mind — grounded in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt level), and a PhD in chemistry • A calm, human presence — able to surface hidden tensions, build trust, and mobilise teams around shared purpose • A strategic posture — focused on results that are both measurable and lasting • A practitioner-researcher mindset — where curiosity fuels continuous learning and deepens the value of my work for clients I bring a strong foundation in operational realities — from the shop floor to senior leadership — combined with certifications in Lean Six-Sigma, Human Centered Design, Executive and Team Coaching, as well as diagnostic tools in Team 360, change leadership and resiliency. In person or virtually, I partner with leadership teams to align with clarity, move forward with cohesion, and generate strategic momentum that lasts.

Our approach is grounded in over 20 years of experience leading high-stakes initiatives in both the private and public sectors. It’s strengthened by deep expertise in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt), human-centred design, and a rigorous scientific foundation (PhD in chemistry). What we’ve learned — time and again — is that no strategy, however robust, leads to sustainable change without healthy team dynamics. As Drucker said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” That’s why we approach every engagement through a dual lens: cross-functional collaboration and relational depth. Because lasting transformation isn’t driven by plans alone — it’s carried by the people who bring them to life. You might be realigning your leadership team, exploring new ways of working, or working to rebuild trust and cohesion — whether in the wake of a challenging period or right in the midst of it.

When your space doesn’t support your nervous system, productivity, and gifts, growth feels exhausting. That’s why I created Soul Sanctuary — a coaching framework that helps neurodivergent and mission-driven solopreneurs transform their workspaces into nervous-system-safe, soul-aligned environments. Through my 5-phase Done-With-You process, we co-create a sanctuary that supports your energy, amplifies your gifts, and attracts aligned clients. ✨ What this looks like: - Visual mapping & design strategy - Trauma-informed, nervous-system-safe coaching - Cyclical productivity tools that honor your flow - Semi-weekly calls with a results-backed guarantee When your space supports you, you can finally do your best work. Alongside coaching, I bring 15+ years of corporate expertise in: - Interior Design & Space Planning - Real Estate & Facilities Management - Workplace Strategy & Environments Strategy - Organizational Change Management As a strategic, transformation-focused leader, I’ve delivered large-scale campus plans, negotiated contracts, optimized global portfolios, and led change initiatives that improved culture, productivity, and costs. My career highlights include developing 5-year master plans for corporate campuses, creating stack plans and flow diagrams, and streamlining space utilization strategies for Fortune 500 clients.

Partner The first step in any relationship is getting to know one another. Such a courtship involves making oneself vulnerable, and in our case will include a HR assessment designed to help us to help you. Our HR assessment sets the stage for the scope of work that we agree needs to be completed. Develop During the Develop phase, we work with you to accomplish the scope of work outlined during the HR assessment. Typically, we implement those programs that will generate immediate, positive financial impact to your organization, a payback that offsets our fee.

Each client is different—needs vary according to programs that may or may not be in effect. The scope of the work involved reflects each organization’s unique situation. Prosper Many organizations realize considerable gains in productivity, employee satisfaction, and reduction in hiring time within weeks of our partnership.

Drawing from experience as a business executive, pastor, educator, and a leading voice in the U.S. faith and work movement, I am passionate to see people fully activated and engaged in their callings, to accelerate and facilitate transformation of leaders and organizations, and for the local church to be equipped to lead people into a biblical understanding of faith, work, and economic wisdom. I was an Area Vice-President with AT&T by age 30, then served as a pastor under Pastor Rick Warren at Saddleback Church where I was the architect and visionary of Saddleback@Work, the workplace ministry. Currently, I am an ICF certified leadership and strategy coach, a professor of ethics, leadership, and strategy at The Crowell School of Business at Biola University, and the Director of the Talbot Center for Faith, Work & Economics where I empower believers to work from biblical principles in all areas of their lives and work with pastors to build organizational competency in the local church to effectively disciple people in their work life.

We call it Business as Ministry. Why is this important? Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact.

true,false,urn:li:member:11885921,Dawn,Parks,,,"You know how hard it is to buy fresh food at reasonable prices year-round that hasn’t travelled thousands of miles and arrived at the grocery store still “green”? Nearly 19 million people in the US live in “food deserts”, meaning they don’t live near a grocery store. It’s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I’m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can “see” how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don’t excite them or detract from what they love working on.

true,false,urn:li:member:2426167,Keith,Liscio,,,"I’m Keith Liscio, the Founder and President of Excelsior Franchise Center. My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners. If you’re serious about being in business, I can find one that will fit your needs.

That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees.

When leaders lead themselves, everything changes. You get a team that: • Owns outcomes instead of escalating issues • Stays steady under pressure • Brings solutions, not problems • Thinks with ownership and perspective Ownership isn’t a personality trait. It’s a skill—and it can be built. I spent 21 years in the U.S. Air Force, where self-leadership wasn’t optional—it was expected. When pressure hit, leaders were trusted to handle what belonged to them. After retiring, I saw the same truth play out everywhere: when leaders don’t lead themselves, someone above them has to. That’s why I built the I Lead Me framework—a practical approach that helps leaders manage pressure, make clear choices, and earn trust where it matters most.

Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business.

false,true,urn:li:member:34882069,Taber,Wetz,taber@taberwetz.com,,"I started my career in merchant and investment banking. It was fast-paced and deal-driven, and I gained exposure to complex financial structures early on. But what always captured my attention wasn’t the capital side — it was the operators. I was drawn to the builders, the entrepreneurs, the people in the trenches scaling something real. After working with several early-stage companies and briefly helping launch a hedge fund, I realized I loved the rhythm of small business — but I needed more than passion; I needed process. A chance meeting with a seasoned fractional CFO and a copy of Traction by Gino Wickman opened my eyes. Finally, there was a framework that matched my instinct. In 2021, I joined a local firm in a junior CFO role. What began as a stepping stone quickly became a proving ground. I helped grow the client base, built internal systems, and took on leadership early. But like many entrepreneurial stories, what I helped build wasn’t mine to own. While at that firm, I met Chris Gauvin — a Canadian, a CPA with a background in consulting and corporate finance. We couldn’t have had more different career paths. I came up through startups, Oklahoma State undergrad, and Dallas finance circles. He came through structured enterprise environments and had an MBA from the University of Texas. But we were in the same stage of life — married, kids the same ages, both driven to build something lasting. That common ground — vision, values, and a desire to finally have ownership in what we were building — led us to launch Local Fractional. We built it for the founders we wish we’d served better before: the ones who need more than bookkeeping and backwards-looking reports. We offer nearshore-powered accounting foundations paired with strategic, fractional CFO leadership. We help you understand where you are AND where you’re going. We deliver monthly reports, KPI analysis, and forward-looking financial strategy — but we don’t stop there. We’re building strategic AI tools that give founders 24/7 insight at their fingertips, because your best ideas don’t always come between 9 and 5. If you’re a founder building something real, we’d love to support your journey. -- If you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far go together --",Co-Founder,Local Fractional provides financial leadership for small to medium sized business.

Part Time or Fractional Executive – A part time executive role that is less than 5 days per week. A good example is a company that requires a senior-level marketing executive, but not every day. So C-Suite will match that company with a marketing executive who works for that company on contract for 1-3 days per week, for example, for the next 12 months. Interim Management Services or Temporary Executives – A temporary or interim executive role that typically is 5 days per week for a short period of time to fill a gap between the departure of one key executive. Leading Key Initiatives, Leading Departments or Leading Companies C-Suite contract executives provide companies like yours with the skills and experience you need to implement new initiatives, develop new strategies for growth, carry out organizational or cultural change, manage complex projects, or fill business-critical roles currently vacant.

I take Core Values off the walls and weave them into the fabric your business. Great companies aren’t built by policies. They’re built by people who believe. And that’s where I come in. I don’t just build HR systems, I build belief. I’ve led culture transformations that have taken organizations from fractured to focused, from toxic to thriving, and from stagnant to scalable. My approach blends data-driven strategy with human-centered leadership because you can’t drive performance without first rebuilding trust. Throughout my career, I’ve been the leader called in to fix what’s broken and rebuild what’s possible. 🔹 At a Fortune 500 Company, I inherited the lowest-performing site in the nation — morale was low, turnover was high, and customer satisfaction was just 18%. Eighteen months later, we achieved 92% satisfaction and cut cycle times from 44 days to 18, outperforming the national average. 🔹 At a private sector company, I built HR infrastructure across eight business units, increasing retention by 35%, productivity by 25%, and reducing benefit costs by 15% — while maintaining 100% audit success. Those outcomes weren’t luck — they came from leadership grounded in three guiding principles: 1️⃣ Listen beyond the words — every voice matters. 2️⃣ Lead with strategy and heart — culture is both compass and engine. 3️⃣ Leave people better than you found them. I’m a People Watcher. A Culture Architect. A Hope Giver. I lead with compassion and excellence — helping executives align business strategy with human potential to drive engagement, retention, and measurable organizational performance.

They struggle because the same leadership capabilities that earned promotion stop scaling as complexity increases. Execution slows, not from effort, but from Leadership Operating System mismatch. As organizations grow, priorities shift faster, decisions become interdependent, and coordination costs rise. Strong leaders work harder, but results don’t compound the way they used to. This is rarely a performance issue. It’s a Leadership Operating System issue. I work with leaders and executive teams to identify where leadership systems built for more stable conditions are breaking under complexity and how to evolve them so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience. My work focuses on upgrading how leaders think, decide, and operate together when scale, uncertainty, and pressure increase. Leadership Operating System Upgrades I Focus On • Escaping the Expert Trap Shifting from individual problem-solving to system-level leadership and decision architecture • Strategic Alignment Architecture Reducing decision latency and coordination friction across functions, teams, and stakeholders • Business Value Translation Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not burnout or heroics Background I bring 20+ years of experience working across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, supporting leadership and organizational reinvention in complex, global environments.

It’s built through awareness, connection, and the confidence to show up with intention, even when the path isn’t clear. This shapes how I’ve led and built leadership and talent development for 2 decades. In my seasoned career, I’ve designed and led leadership development, performance management, and career path initiatives across organizations at different stages of growth. I partner closely with executives, HR leaders, and managers to strengthen the everyday moments that define leadership: setting direction, giving feedback, navigating ambiguity, and supporting people through change. Through FutureForm, I work with leaders and teams to develop three timeless leadership capabilities: Clarity - Helping leaders focus on what matters most and communicate it so teams can move with confidence. Connection - Building trust, psychological safety, and real understanding between leaders and their teams. Confidence - Supporting leaders to lead with steadiness, humility, and authenticity, without relying on control. Career clarity is a core part of this work. When leaders and employees understand their strengths, values, and direction, performance improves, engagement deepens, and retention follows. Clarity at the individual level strengthens leadership at the organizational level.

true,true,urn:li:member:293034752,Mason,Scurry,,,"By the age of 22, I'd: - Founded 4 businesses and sold 1 - Founded 2 non-profits and been program director at a 3rd - Directly mentored 300+ young entrepreneurs - Been appointed to faculty of an Ivy League University - Published 2 books Naturally, when I graduated from Brown, I had no interest in getting a job. But I had to make a living, so I founded a marketing agency. I worked with B2B service businesses, and promised them what everyone does. More marketing means: - More leads - More clients - More revenue Long story short, that didn't happen. I wasn't getting results because my approach was wrong. I noticed: Like most businesses, when B2B service firms want more clients, they invest in marketing. They chase cold leads, lose a ton of money, and wonder why nothing's working. So rather than being yet another run-of-the-mill marketing agency, I pivoted. Now, I build infrastructure to get more referrals. Why? It's the cheapest, fastest, and most effective way for a B2B service firm to grow. WHAT I BUILD: Referable Brand → Positioning and messaging so clients know exactly who to refer to you Validation-Ready Digital Presence → Website and LinkedIn optimized for referral confidence, not SEO traffic Relationship CRM → Automated touchpoints that keep your network warm and generate systematic referrals WHO THIS IS FOR: Established B2B service firms ($500K-$5M) with 20+ client relationships but no system to leverage them. Consulting firms, agencies, coaches. WHY REFERRALS ARE BETTER: - They convert 71% higher than paid leads - They close 69% faster - Retention rates are 37% higher You might worry about being dependent on referrals. Odds are, you're not dependent ENOUGH. I've built infrastructure for 20+ clients in the past year—creative agencies, solo consultants, coaches, EOS implementers, even a catering company. Ready to do what ACTUALLY works? Book a free 60-minute strategy session. I'll tell you how to sign 5 new clients without spending a dime. (It's not magic, it's referrals)",Founder and Principal,"I help B2B founders build client acquisition systems rooted in relationships, not lead generation. Services: - CRM design & implementation (built for trust, not tracking) - LinkedIn & outreach strategy (conversations, not cold pitching) - Marketing automation (that feels human) - Fractional CMO services Approach: Unlike traditional consultants who hand you templates, I design custom systems based on the psychology of relationships. This leads to 3x more referrals, 37% higher retention, and businesses founders actually love running. Who I work with: B2B founders, consultants, agencies, and service providers tired of pushy sales tactics.",12/2024,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-scurry,"Athens, Georgia, United States",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:105852343,Scurry Consulting,https://www.linkedin.com/company/customer-acquisition-consulting-llc/,www.masonscurryconsulting.com,"At Scurry Consulting, we help entrepreneurs build better businesses by designing simple, effective systems that support sustainable growth. We work with founders who have vision, traction, and drive—but lack the structure to scale with confidence. We specialize in three things: 1. Sales Funnels that Convert 2. CRMs that Work for You 3. Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you.

Columbia University achieved junior college status in 1922, and in 1925 the College of Arts and Sciences was founded. Four years later the first bachelor’s degrees were awarded to a class of seven men. In the 1930s, the University’s name was changed to the University of Portland, the St. Vincent Hospital School of Nursing became part of the University as the College of Nursing, and the School of Business were created. In 1948, the School of Engineering was created. The University established its Graduate School in 1950 and the School of Education in 1962. In 1967 the Congregation of Holy Cross and the University’s Board of Regents transitioned to a shared governance structure. Today, the University continues to be guided by the Congregation of Holy Cross and governed by an independent board of directors.

Dr. Andy uniquely emphasizes a positive psychology approach that utilizes established individual, familial, and organizational strengths rather than underscoring what may be pathological or dysfunctional. In blending this approach with a systems theoretical model, existential psychology, and solution-focused strategies, he's empowered to provide a transformative brand of coaching and consulting. Throughout his career, he’s contributed a significant and meaningful role as a consultant for multiple faith-based organizations - where he specializes in empowering his clients to discover and establish their True North identity, purpose, and community - and then integrate radically resilient principles, practices, and strategies - that enable his clients to consistently achieve their biggest goals and actualize their greatest potential. Dr. Andy has made a considerable impact working as a performance coach for high performing executives, elite athletes, and organizations throughout Southern California - and beyond (his online coaching curriculum has been effectively utilized and taught throughout the US - and even in select European countries). Dr. Andy has developed a thriving private practice in the renowned Newport Beach area, and he offers custom private workshops, corporate training programs, he is a highly sought after speaker and podcast guest, and he continues to offer concierge style coaching services (although - openings with Dr. Andy are rare to come by - so, if you are interested in working with him one on one - you should get on his waiting list ASAP!).","Founder and President of AG Thrive Psychological Consultation, Inc.",,07/2016,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-andy-garrett-64a3a670,"Newport Beach, California, United States",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:18766680,AG Thrive,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ag-thrive/,https://www.ag-thrive.com/,"Thrive by Design Counselors, Coaches, and Consultants.

In this process you will gain the capacity and confidence to establish relationships that are meaningful, fulfilling, and lasting. Over the course of completing my doctoral studies and clinical training at Azusa Pacific University – I developed a unique style of psychotherapy which has proven to be highly effective. I have worked in some of the most reputable psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics, educational institutions, and private practice settings in Southern California. These opportunities have allowed me the privilege of working with a diverse population of adolescents, adults, couples, and families. I have developed specific interests and training in treating psychological issues that include anxiety, depression, life transitions, addictions (including substance abuse related issues, food addictions, and compulsive gambling), faith/religious distress, and grief.

I am an Execution Risk Diagnostics & Advisory for Professional Services Firms and founder of CollabIntel™ Consulting Group. I work with senior executives responsible for operational performance, profitability, and cross-functional execution in midsize professional-services firms. My work starts where traditional consulting stops: exposing the structural breakdowns inside the People OS, Team OS, and Execution OS that create rework, stalled decisions, uneven delivery, and operational drag. Using diagnostic-driven operating models, I quantify the financial cost of misalignment and redesign the collaboration architecture so firms move faster, deliver consistently, and protect margin under pressure — without relying on heroics or a handful of overloaded contributors. I also created CollabCode™, a structural methodology and certification pathway for practitioners who want to build and sustain collaboration as an operating discipline. Not personality. Not chemistry. Infrastructure. If your firm is facing rising rework, slow decisions, uneven client delivery, or increasing compensation costs for system gaps, the issue isn’t performance — it’s architecture.

Eastern added graduate studies in 1935, and thirteen years later, in 1948, the General Assembly removed the word Teachers from the school's name, and granted it the right to award nonprofessional degrees.

false,true,urn:li:member:109892510,Chris,"Baker, fcaio",,,"Most organizations are drowning in tools they don't need, solving for problems they haven't defined. I help small businesses and nonprofits get aligned before AI, build structure before scale, and create systems that serve people—not the other way around. THE PROBLEM Leaders buy systems before documenting their sales process. They buy automation before clarifying workflow. They chase AI before knowing what problems they're solving. Result? Expensive technology that creates chaos, not clarity. The tech industry profits from this confusion. I don't. ALIGNED BEFORE AI I published a book by this title because I'm tired of watching businesses waste money on premature technology. CLARITY BEFORE COMPLEXITY – Before tools, we clarify what you're trying to accomplish. Until you can articulate this, no software will save you. STRUCTURE BEFORE SCALE – You cannot automate chaos. If processes are broken, AI breaks them faster. We build documented workflows first, then introduce technology. HUMANS BEFORE HYPE – AI amplifies what exists. Confused teams get more confused. Aligned teams become force multipliers. WHAT I'VE BUILT As Founder of Align & Innovate, I provide fractional Chief AI & Systems Officer services to organizations needing strategic technology leadership. Before that, I co-founded Visuals by Momo, helping 50+ nonprofits tell emotionally resonant stories through documentary productions. That taught me: the best technology means nothing if you can't tell a coherent story about what you do. I bring that lens to systems work. Every CRM, every workflow, every AI strategy—it's storytelling. I also host Visual Eyes Podcast, exploring storytelling, technology, and community impact. WHO I WORK WITH Leaders tired of tools that promise transformation but deliver headaches. Leaders ready to invest in foundational systems instead of chasing shiny objects. What I don't do: Sell software you don't need. Build AI that impresses investors but confuses teams. What I do: Ask hard questions. Design systems that reduce friction. Train teams to own tools—not be owned by them.

At Return to Home Port®, a strategic management services firm, we are focused on bridging the military-to-civilian transition, I help connect employers with military-connected talent, navigate workforce programs and certifications, and design deliberate strategies that maximize organizational and individual outcomes. We use proprietary planning and analytical methodologies to foster meaningful relationships between employers and military-trained talent, unlocking value for businesses and transitioning service members alike. In my professional journey, I proudly served in the U.S. Navy — an experience that instilled in me a deeply rooted commitment to leadership, disciplined execution, and mission focus. Building on that foundation, I earned my Master of Science in Human Resources Leadership from West Virginia University, equipping me with advanced expertise in talent strategy, organizational development, and people-centered solutions. I went on to found an HR Consultancy - Cappellos Holdings (DBA Cappellos HR Solutions) and boot strapped $500k of professional services in my first two years of business as a single owner and operator.

Turns out, the frameworks that work aren't industry-specific. They're builder-specific. Here's what I've learned: The best brands don't just look good. They feel right. They create resonance, not just reach. The best systems don't just work once. They scale across contexts. What fixes patient experience also fixes customer acquisition. The best leaders don't choose between growth and sanity. They refuse to sacrifice soul for systems.

false,true,urn:li:member:36916412,Tonya,Gossage,,,"I help owner-led businesses scale without burnout by fixing three things: capacity, visibility, and referral-driven growth. When growth stalls, it’s rarely a talent issue. It’s usually a bottleneck, unclear execution, or a visibility gap. I’m a Business Growth Strategist and growth partner to small to mid-size business owners who want to lead like the CEO of their business, not the busiest employee in it. What I do: 1) Capacity (Delegation + Virtual Professionals) I start with a time and workflow audit, then design the proper role and outcomes. Through my Gentask alliance, I can connect you with vetted virtual professionals once the role is clear. Visibility (Free Visibility Audit + SEO strategy): If you’re not getting the leads you should from Google, or you’re paying for marketing but can’t clearly verify outcomes, I’ll run a free visibility (SEO) audit and show you what’s working, what’s missing, and what to fix first. After the audit, if you decide you want to move forward, I will remain as your strategy and accountability lead, my proven SEO implementation team executes the optimization work, and I review the reporting with you, translate what it means, and adjust priorities month-to-month. 3) Referrals (The Power Connectors™) I build referral-first ecosystems where business owners create warm introductions, strategic partnerships, and real deal flow.

Por eso fundé Estimada Rebel, no como un proyecto más, sino como un movimiento para rediseñar el lugar que ocupamos las mujeres en las empresas: con poder, propósito y autonomía. Hoy, como CEO de Estimada Rebel, diseño e implemento programas de alto impacto como Confident Rebel y Rebel Leader, además de asesorar a organizaciones que buscan transformar sus culturas hacia un liderazgo más inclusivo. A través de nuestro enfoque estratégico, miles de mujeres han fortalecido su confianza, aprendido a comunicar su valor y avanzado hacia puestos de liderazgo con visión, ambición y sin culpa. Mi carrera comenzó mucho antes de emprender. He liderado equipos en GBM, la institución financiera independiente más grande de México, RIU Hotels & Resorts y el British Council, enfrentando de cerca los desafíos de crecer profesionalmente en estructuras donde las decisiones se toman —aún hoy— sin mujeres en la mesa. Esa experiencia no solo afiló mi mirada estratégica, sino que encendió mi convicción: no basta con abrir espacio, hay que preparar a más mujeres para ocuparlo con claridad, autoridad y resultados. Mi formación como Business Coach certificada por Newfield Consulting, bajo la metodología de Rafael Echeverría, y mi especialización en Liderazgo Femenino por Harvard Business School, respaldan una propuesta que integra desarrollo personal, confianza profesional y visión de negocio.

false,false,urn:li:member:32676434,Norma,Frahn,nsfrahn@gmail.com,,"I’ve spent my entire career inside HR. But the people I care about most aren’t sitting in corporate boardrooms. They’re running skilled trades and service businesses. They’re out in the field early, managing crews, juggling schedules, solving problems in real time — and doing everything they can to keep the work moving and their people supported. And almost every one of them has said some version of the same thing to me: “I know HR matters… I just don’t have the time. And honestly, I’m not even sure where to start.” That’s exactly why I founded On Demand HR Solutions. Small, growing trades businesses don’t need corporate HR theory or overbuilt policies that don’t fit how the work actually gets done. They need simple, practical HR support — delivered in a way that works alongside the business, not on top of it. That’s where I come in. I work as an independent on-demand HR partner for skilled trades businesses, and I offer a few clear ways to get support, depending on what you need right now: HR SOS Session A focused, one-hour working session to tackle one specific HR issue — a people problem, compliance question, hiring concern, or “this just came up and I need help” situation. HR Blueprint A short-term, hands-on engagement to put the HR foundations in place — clear policies, better hiring and onboarding, and simple systems that bring structure and consistency to how you manage your crew. HR Advisory Ongoing HR support for owners who want a trusted partner in their corner — someone they can call, message, or loop in when questions come up, decisions need to be made, or issues start to surface. No over-engineered solutions. No corporate speak. No judgment. Just honest, practical HR support designed for businesses where the work happens in the field. I believe HR should make running a business easier — not harder. If you’re not sure which option makes sense, that’s okay. Most people aren’t. Send me a message here on LinkedIn and tell me what’s going on. I’ll help you figure out the simplest next step. 📥 Message me on LinkedIn — I’m just one DM away.",Founder & Principal Consultant,"After more than 30 years leading HR in complex corporate environments, I started noticing a pattern. Small, growing skilled trades businesses were being asked to manage the same HR responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, safety, compliance, employee issues — without the time, support, or internal HR teams that larger companies rely on. Most owners don't want to “do HR.” They just wanted the work to run smoothly, their crews supported, and their business protected. So I founded On Demand HR Solutions to meet them where they are. Today, I work as an on-demand HR partner for skilled trades and field-based businesses, helping owners put practical HR systems in place that actually work in real life. My focus is HR operations and people management that supports how trades businesses run day to day. That includes everything from hiring and onboarding crews, to setting clear expectations, handling employee issues, and staying compliant as the business grows. I step in where HR usually falls through the cracks and help bring structure, clarity, and consistency without overcomplicating things. What this looks like in practice: - Acting as the HR department for small trades businesses, providing on-demand guidance, HR administration, and compliance support - Supporting owners through sensitive employee relations issues with a balance of compassion, clarity, and compliance - Building right-sized HR foundations — handbooks, policies, onboarding processes, and basic systems that crews can actually follow - Providing fractional or interim HR support when a business needs experienced HR leadership without hiring full-time - Helping owners move from reactive, day-to-day people issues to more stable, repeatable ways of managing their teams This work allows me to do what I care about most: Making HR feel manageable for business owners who already have enough on their plates — and helping trades businesses grow without the constant stress of “figuring it out as they go.”",2024,https://www.linkedin.com/in/normafrahn,"Glenville, Pennsylvania, United States",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:105839078,On Demand HR Solutions,https://www.linkedin.com/company/on-demand-hr-solutlions/,https://www.ondemandhrsolutions.com/,"Are you trying to run your business but constantly pulled into HR tasks you didn’t sign up for?
