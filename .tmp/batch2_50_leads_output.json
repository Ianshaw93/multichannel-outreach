    "summary": "AI is flattening organizations faster than most leaders can adapt. Skilled managers are downsized. Layers are shrinking. Work is speeding up. And leadership models built on control and hierarchy are breaking down. I provide architecture that makes teams self-managing for Fractionals, Business Owners, Consultants and Coaches. Leaders and HR partners tell me the same thing: “We know collaboration matters—but we can’t measure it, sustain it, or scale it.” That’s where the TIGERS® 6 Principles System comes in. It equips leaders and HR partners to turn AI-driven flattening into a human advantage through measurable trust, collaboration, and engagement. For more than 30 years, I’ve helped organizations—from Fortune 500s to nonprofits—create high-trust, self-aligning cultures that thrive in complexity. The TIGERS System builds six measurable principles that drive collaboration: Trust | Interdependence | Genuineness | Empathy | Risk Resolution | Success. These aren’t soft skills. They’re behavioral metrics that leaders can observe, measure, and scale. That’s why we license this framework to coaches, consultants, and HR partners who want to deliver sustainable, people-centered transformation that makes work easier not harder. When trust becomes measurable, transformation becomes unstoppable.

    "summary": "From a young age, I’ve had an innate desire to help people. Whether it was identifying problems when no one else was looking, asking the probing questions that every parent dreads, or offering solutions—sometimes unsolicited—I was always driven to make things better. If you had asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answers would have included lawyer, police officer, or doctor. As I got older, I knew those weren't right for me. My career journey has taken me through various sectors, including small to medium-sized businesses, the service industry, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C., a mega-church, and local government. In each organization, I consistently sought to understand the challenges at hand. I asked questions, identified issues, and proposed solutions—some welcomed, others less so. Regardless of the setting, my focus remained on finding the most strategic and logical paths forward. This involved refining existing processes and systems. One recurring theme across all these organizations was a lack of clarity in management and leadership. Employees often struggled with unclear expectations, resulting in low morale and plenty of “water cooler” conversations post-meetings. Furthermore, genuine people development was frequently overlooked. Through my diverse work experiences and education, I discovered the sweet spot where my skills and passions intersected. Today, I have the privilege of helping businesses transform their operations and cultures. I collaborate closely with business owners to diagnose their challenges and craft tailored growth strategies. The best part? They define what success looks like for them, and together we build a roadmap to achieve it. Are You Facing These Challenges? ⏩ Is your business growing but you're unsure how to sustain that momentum? ⏩ Is your team not performing at the level you know they can? ⏩ Are you bogged down by a lack of clarity and ineffective processes that hinder your growth? ⏩ Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed as a business owner or CEO and longing for more balance in your life? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, I want to invite you into a conversation. This initial conversation will help us diagnose the issues within your business and identify actionable strategies you can implement right away.

Women served on some committees but, were not allowed to hold office and did not have voting privileges. Because women were paid lower salaries in those days, most women could not afford to join the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1950, that all changed. Martha McKinley received permission from the President of the Chamber to form a “Women’s Section”, with dues more affordable to the working women of that time. They were to have their own Officers and Bylaws. For the next 40 years, the Women’s Section acted as a support group for the Chamber. In 1990 it was time for a change and thus evolved the Fresno County Women’s Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) organization. Our mission is to provide and promote professional opportunities, personal development, financial growth, community leadership and legislative awareness for women. We believe in supporting each other and watching our members’ successes. By encouraging others to do business with fellow members, members see their business and friendships grow.

I was surrounded by leaders in the wrong positions and people in positions of authority who had no business being there. I want to give people who are considering leadership, those in leadership who are struggling, and executives who are over their heads an opportunity to develop before they hurt someone or themselves. I want to see the day when workers do not have to go home and consume their dinner and talk about the underdeveloped and unprepared leaders they work for. Do you know the leader I am talking about or is that you? Ok, so here is all the other stuff people want to see: I am a Best-selling author of A Lion's Pride: The Scars That Silenced Kings, and I co-authored Voices for Leadership: Your Pathway to Becoming a More Influential Leader, The Latino Leadership Playbook, and Latinos 100. I have served as an Executive, Business Owner, Veteran & Advocate, Board Member, Non-Profit Administrator, Speaker, Mentor, Coach, and Avid Volunteer. Over the past 30 years, I have held numerous executive advisor and senior positions while serving in the United States Navy and civilian sector. Through education and training, I helped strengthen the chain of command and businesses, providing sound decision support and creating open communication at all levels. I also helped formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, and training of Navy and civilian personnel. My performance won me the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. I was named 2013, 2014, and 2017 Mentor of the Year, and recipient of the inaugural 2014 Chief John Dungan Jr. Oceanographer of the Navy Award. I was also awarded The Arnold Fletcher Award and inducted into the SALUTE National honors society for my academic achievements. I volunteer actively for various projects and non-profits, earning the esteemed Bronze, Silver, and Gold President’s Volunteer Service Award. I host the Award-Winning Developing the Leader Within Podcast. On the DTLW Podcast, I share real-world leadership lessons shaped by my personal experiences, challenges, and victories. Having overcome significant obstacles, including 26 years of Naval service, I know what it takes to lead with resilience and authenticity.

Every organization that ignores the Culture Gap ends up paying for it: through lost revenue, disengaged talent, failed synergies, and missed opportunity. As a leader in a global company you have a choice: Talk to a cross-cultural expert now, or call them when the damage is done. Either way, you'll need to address culture… because it always shows up.

    "summary": "If you are a CEO, entrepreneur or business owner pursuing mergers or acquisitions as part of your growth strategy, let’s talk. There’s a reason CEO's call me an \"M&A Whisperer\". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the \"unexpected people challenges\" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, \"NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions\" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc. Honored as Entrepreneur of the Year by Northshore Women in Business in 2019, I was recently ranked the #1 M&A Leadership Consultant by Leadership Research Institute and nominated to Thinkers50 2024 Radar list of future management thinkers to watch.

    "summary": "I'm not an exit consultant. I help owners build businesses they never want to sell. (Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: \"I can't take a real vacation without chaos\" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: \"I need to scale but organic growth is too slow\" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: \"I want options but don't know where to start\" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: \"It's time. Get me the best outcome possible\" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison. Multiple options = freedom. 📊 Find out where you stand: Send me a message and let's talk about where you are and where you want to be. 📚 Or start with my book: \"Unlocking Small Business Value\" The playbook I wish I'd had for my first acquisition: https://grw.bz/unlock P.S.

    "summary": "Are you a leader, social entrepreneur, or creative professional feeling disconnected from your purpose, struggling to balance impact with personal well-being, or finding yourself stuck in old patterns? Do you find your team stuck in old patterns, rehashing past challenges instead of moving towards a more generative future? As a social entrepreneur, are you struggling to align your deep values with your daily actions, and find a clear path to making the impact you desire? At Heyman Partners, we understand these challenges. We help leaders, social entrepreneurs, and creative professionals move past these obstacles to achieve impact with joy through integrated growth and aligned purpose. We guide individuals and organizations to the sweet spot where they can make a real difference while maintaining a deep sense of fulfillment. I've worked with many leaders who, while managing people and resources, guiding strategy and implementation, and confronting disagreement, sometimes neglect their own internal boundaries, leading to overwhelm and burnout. I've also learned that while occasionally rehashing \"war stories\" can be instructive, focusing on those times can keep you and your team stuck in the past, rather than moving towards a generative future. In my work, I help my clients learn to develop healthy boundaries, shift away from trauma bonds, and move forward with generative energy. Here’s what some of my clients say: “I threw out a number of goals and within 20 minutes we had compelling and inspiring direction.” “She has twice lead out team in decision making that enabled us to thrive and grow as an organization.” “She could cut to the heart of an issue and help us find our way there, and also a path forward.” Are you or your team ready to discover your sweet spot where impact and joy intersect? We believe that clarity of purpose, quality of interaction, and aligned action can transform your work and life, leading to more sustainable and generative outcomes. If you are ready to bring joy and fulfillment back into your work, and align your values and actions for a greater impact, visit my website in my profile section to learn more about our integrative approach to growth and how we can help you find your sweet spot.",

    "summary": "I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

    "company_description": "As the CEO of a mid-sized service enterprise, are you aiming for dramatic revenue growth–ranging from a solid 25% to an ambitious 100%? Is your vision for growth failing to inspire enthusiastic followership? Do your ideas get brushed aside? Are strategic misalignments and execution uncertainties sapping your team’s energy and direction? Imagine pinpointing your next $10-$100 million in revenue, with your team aligned and clear on their future goals, and where your leadership is heard and understood. The challenge often lies in clinging to outdated strategies. For years, your teams have been incentivized to keep what’s in place going. Anything ‘new’ might get in the way, add risk, or slow things down. They don’t see that one of the greatest risks in business today is not adapting on purpose and by design. With over 25+ years of experience in pioneering first-of-their-kind projects, I’ve driven over $2 billion in unprecedented sales growth through strategic market entries, service expansions, and enhanced customer experiences. I also fueled over $500 million in sales by repositioning brands, crafting exit valuation stories, and unlocking new channels and opportunities. Consultants come and go, but Mike’s commitment to our growth has been unwavering since he helped us redefine our brand. Mike empowered us to become the brand we aspired to be, giving us permission to jettison the limiting preconceptions. Since our initial collaboration, we’ve experienced a tenfold increase in growth–achievements we could not have reached without his insight and guidance. – Christoper Iansiti - Board Chair For transformative revenue growth of 25-100%, contact me at +1 404.229.5809 for a confidential conversation.",

    "summary": "WHAT I DO: For more than 35 years and over 600 engagements, I have rapidly helped companies with revenue $5MM to $50MM fix their cash flow and plan cash flow and operations changes for future profitability. Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher™. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME™) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME™ trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach™ program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)– because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME™ company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment – again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours. Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,620,000,000 in debt and saved 14,731 jobs.

    "job_description": "WHY IT MATTERS: Cash flow is the life-blood of your business. When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher™ tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME™ helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME™ gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years. STATISTICS: Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,355,000,000 in debt and saved 13,414 jobs. WHAT I DO: cash flow coaching, turnaround consulting, turnaround management, change company outcomes, restructure debt, refinance distressed companies, sell distressed companies, TAME™, Cash Flow Launcher™, free cash flow model.",

I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs.

For over 17 years, I’ve partnered with CEOs, executive teams, and boards across venture capital, private equity, and Fortune 100 companies to align people strategies with business strategies, creating cultures that drive performance and innovation. As a C-suite Advisor on Talent, I specialize in helping leaders thrive amid uncertainty. My approach is rooted in understanding the complex interplay between people and organizations—designing strategies that not only meet immediate business needs but also foster long-term growth and resilience. I’ve had the privilege of consulting for global organizations, including Nike, Amazon, McKinsey, and Microsoft, as well as scaling startups, guiding them through inflection points that required deep leadership transformation and organizational redesign. Leadership, in my view, is not just about the individual; it’s about the intersection of culture, strategy, and human dynamics. By aligning human capital strategy with business objectives, organizations can navigate complexity and achieve sustainable success. I believe that trust, agility, and strategic talent development are essential for any organization looking to thrive in today’s rapidly changing landscape. As a reticulist, I bring together diverse, often unlikely, groups of people to create innovative solutions to today’s most pressing challenges. By convening different perspectives, I believe we can drive breakthroughs that push the boundaries of what’s possible—whether in business transformation, innovation, or addressing societal needs.

    "summary": "Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS. Track Record - Creator of the ROE (Return on Empathy) model and International Best Selling Author - Global keynote speaker on empathy, EQ psychological safety (U.S., Africa, Europe, SE Asia) - 25+ years leading teams in engineering, construction & high-risk government projects - Leading organizations from accidental to intentional cultures, rooted in their values and aligned with their vision. - Sparring partner for leaders across STEM, Operations and Federal Government Ready to turn empathy into your next strategic advantage?
