    "about": "I'm Ian, I help discerning investors, families and business owners take back as much of their time as possible, while making sure they don't miss out of investment opportunities, and tax strategies to keep more of their wealth and pay as little as possible to Uncle Sam.\n\n\nThe way we'll work together is a bit different than what most people are used to, or expect from a financial advisor. Here's how we create a team that works for YOU:\n\nWe act as a Personal CFO (Chief Financial Officer) for you or your family / business. We help you build and manage your \"Wealth Team\" - the group of specialists that guides through every financial area: Tax preparation, Investments, Real Estate, Banking, Estate Planning, Corporate Law, Insurance, etc.\n\nMost people we talk to have accumulated various professionals in these disciplines over time, and each one exists in their own \"silo\", and rarely do they communicate, let alone work together to make sure you're not missing out on any strategies or opportunities.\n\nWe come and help you make sure:\n1. Those specialists are all \"A\" players - they are experts in their field, and they're proactive.\n2. They work together and communicate.\n\nWe take over as the main point of contact for your \"Wealth Team\" so that you don't have to waste time having the same conversation with each one of them to try to get anything done.\n\nWe're simply adding a buffer for you - so that you can spend your time on what you enjoy most. When you get a \"Pitch\" of some product, investment strategy or idea, you simply toss it to us, we'll evaluate it with your team, and then present it to you if we think it makes sense. If it doesn't - you don't have to worry about it again.\n\nTime is your most precious resource, we help you keep it, and spend it well.\n\nSend DM to request a Strategy Session",

After they start thinking about retirement.\n\nAnd I get it. Life is chaos. You're just trying to survive.\n\nBut when you wait, you're now making six-figure decisions while you're emotionally fried, overwhelmed, and out of time.\n\nThat's when mistakes happen. Expensive ones.\n\nThat's why I'm obsessed with working with people before the transition hits.\n\nBefore the baby comes and you're too tired to think straight.\n\nBefore the job change when you still have options.\n\nEspecially a few years before retirement when there's still time to optimize everything.\n\nBecause when you plan ahead, you're calm. You're thoughtful. You make better decisions.\n\nSo if there's a little voice in your head right now saying, \"Hmm, should I be working with someone?\"\n\nListen to it.\n\nThat voice is right. And it's probably about six months late already. \n\nDon't let it be a year.\n\nDM me.

Ideally 12-18 months out.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause if we're going to work together through something major, we need time. \n\nTime for me to learn how you think.

        "description": "I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a Home+Soul Re'Fresh session with Nalasa, and I cannot recommend it enough! From start to finish, the session was both calming and invigorating, leaving me feeling renewed and refreshed in both my personal mindset as well as the plan for the interior of my new home. \n\nNalasa's attention to detail is unparalleled, and I was amazed at how she immediately tuned into our unique circumstances as it relates to the land and property of our building site. She provided several recommendations right away as to how we can align and be congruent moving forward. \n\nI have never really designed a home with my personal aesthetic because we knew we weren\u2019t staying put, so I have always focused on what would resell.  But instead of enjoying the process of FINALLY getting to do whatever I want, it was overshadowed by the stress of making a zillion decisions and making sure everything is right!  We are putting a lot of money into this home, so I want to make sure it has the feel and design that is scattered into a bunch of different pieces in my brain! \n\nThroughout the session, Nalasa's energy was positive and infectious, making the process both enjoyable and transformative. She calmed me down \ud83d\ude0a and gave me some great next steps to chunk things up and prioritize, which will help me during the design (and budgeting!) process so that I don\u2019t feel so out of control.\n\nShe was able to pull a \u201cvision\u201d out of me, which I hadn\u2019t really been able to describe. Nalasa asked me questions that helped me identify what it is that I love \u2013 and more accurately, the emotions that they make me feel, such that I can bring that into the interior design of my home.  She gave me clarity, structure, and confidence in the decisions I make to turn my vision into reality. \n\nThank you so much, Nalasa \u2013 I have a renewed, expansive perspective\u2026 and I now have a structure to bring my vision and how I want my environment to feel into my home so that I can live my dream every day!\nI highly recommend working with Nalasa. Her work is truly transformative, and I cannot wait to see the final result. Thank you, Nalasa, for helping me create a space that truly nourishes my soul!\n\nCami Low\nCEO Results By Cami",

    "about": "If you're an entrepreneur who wants to scale your business to 7 figures without burning out, this is for you\u2193\n\nMost of us have been taught to set incremental goals to achieve incremental progress. That works, but it sells us short. For all the media frenzy about artificial intelligence, the most powerful computer on the planet is still the one between your ears. If you program it with the right set of instructions, it will give you the results you seek.\n\nI can show you how to do the right programming to scale your business to 7 figures without burning out. Think of it as prompt engineering for human intelligence.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing complicated about it. There\u2019s no ten-step process to memorize, no checklist to follow, no mantra to chant. It\u2019s not limited by language, gender, culture, race, education, age, or IQ. Anyone on the planet can do this, as long as they\u2019re committed to the outcome.\n\nThink of commitment as the ultimate prompt to your brain. If you\u2019re daydreaming about something, your brain isn\u2019t receiving any instructions to make it happen. But when you commit to it, your brain immediately switches into a different gear and starts doing everything in its power, which is considerable, to give you what you\u2019re committed to.\n\nThe problem is, most of us don\u2019t commit to much. I can still remember being told when I was a kid that if I don\u2019t expect too much from life I won\u2019t be disappointed. That was true as far as it went, but it didn\u2019t go very far, and it didn\u2019t take me very far. I had to learn the hard way that the world will pay whatever price you ask from it. If you ask little, you\u2019ll receive little. If you ask a great deal, then you\u2019ll receive a great deal.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: If you\u2019re willing to commit to scaling your business to 7 figures without burning out (even if you think that's impossible!) then I can help you achieve it. \n\nFull Stop.\n\nBut I can\u2019t help you commit to it. I can\u2019t give you a compelling reason to want something enough to be willing to commit to it. That has to come from you.\n\nBut when you're ready, when you're committed, I can help you make it happen.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ve boiled it down to a playbook that lays it all out for you, and for a limited time I can send you a copy for free.\n\nHere's the link:\n\nhttps://www.keithellis.com/about-keith-ellis-2",

        "jobDescription": "Do you ever feel trapped by your success?\n\nYou've created a thriving business, and that feels great, but the more successful you become, the more your business takes over your life. That's not so great. \n\nI bet you created your business to give yourself and your family a greater sense of financial freedom, and beyond that, to have the time and resources to enjoy all that life offers. And yet, the harder you work, the more trapped you feel.\n\nSo you hire business coaches and consultants, and they help you grow your business, at least incrementally, but they can't seem to help you scale it to the level you\u2019ve always dreamed about because you just don't have any more time or energy to give.\n\nEven worse, the more you do grow your business, the more it sucks the life out of you.\n \nYou\u2019ve reached the point where you can\u2019t tell whether you own your business or your business owns you. I call this \u201csuccess prison\". \n\nWell, I've been there and done that, and I've escaped from success prison, so I can finally enjoy both my success and my life. And I can help you do the same.\n \nI know, it sounds impossible to scale your business to 7 figures by reducing the demands your business makes on you. But that's what makes it work.\n\nThe secret is to commit to an Impossible Goal\u2122. This turns conventional wisdom on its head by liberating you from the trap of incremental progress, so you're finally unleashed to pursue your dreams, start living again, and enjoy the time, energy, and resources to do it all.\n\nBut there is a trick to it, and it\u2019s something they don\u2019t teach in business school: \n\nIt\u2019s actually easier to achieve Impossible Goals\u2122 than it is to be \"realistic\".\n\nAt this point, you probably find that hard to believe, but by the time you finish reading my new book, I guarantee you\u2019ll understand.\n\nAnd for a limited time, I will give you a free copy. \n\nDM me \"Scale to 7\" and I'll send you the link.",

        "summary": "Most of us have spent our lives following the conventional wisdom that incremental progress will eventually yield success. There's truth in that, but there's also something very important that's missing. When you focus on incremental goals and incremental progress, you end up burying yourself under details that leave you exhausted, overwhelmed, and wondering how you got into this predicament in the first place. \n\nTo put it another way, do you ever feel trapped by your success?\n\nYou've created a thriving business, and that feels great, but the more successful you become, the more your business takes over your life. That's not so great. \n\nI bet you created your business to give yourself and your family a greater sense of financial freedom, and beyond that, to have the time and resources to enjoy all that life offers. And yet, the harder you work, the more trapped you feel. I call this \u201csuccess prison\". \n\nI know it sounds like a cliche to say that I've been there and done that, but I really have been there, and I really have done that. More importantly, I've escaped from success prison, so I can finally enjoy both my success and my life. And I can show you how to do the same. \n\nI know, it sounds impossible to be able to scale your business exponentially while actually scaling back the demands your business makes on you. And that\u2019s why I call it \"Impossible Success\".\n \nThe secret is to turn conventional wisdom on its head by liberating yourself from the trap of \u2018realistic\u2019 goals, so you're finally free to pursue your dreams, and start living again, and you finally have the time, energy, and resources to do it all.\n\nBut there is a trick to it, and it\u2019s something they don\u2019t teach in business school:\n\nIt\u2019s actually easier to achieve \u201cimpossible success\u201d than it is to be realistic.\n\nAt this point, you probably find that hard to believe, but by the time you finish reading this book, I guarantee you\u2019ll understand.",

And yet, the harder you work, the more trapped you feel.\n\nSo you hire business coaches and consultants, and they help you grow your business, at least incrementally, but they can't seem to help you scale it to the level you\u2019ve always dreamed about because you just don't have any more time or energy to give.\n\nEven worse, the more you do grow your business, the more it sucks the life out of you.\n \nYou\u2019ve reached the point where you can\u2019t tell whether you own your business or your business owns you. I call this \u201csuccess prison\". \n\nWell, I've been there and done that, and finally figured out how to escape from success prison, so I'm free to enjoy both my success and my life.

I know I would be if it hadn't actually happened to me.\n\nBut it did, and I accidentally discovered a mind-blowing secret that allows me to live the life I've always dreamed about.\n\nAnd now this secret can do the same for you.\n\nIt all began when I joined a tiny Internet startup named webMethods. I was only their sixth employee.\nAs the newly-minted VP of Sales my job was to sell a product that wasn\u2019t finished, from a company no one had ever heard of, to a market that didn\u2019t exist.\n\nI struggled.\n\nWhen we were running out of money, I was still struggling, and we were running out of time.\n\nAnd then somehow, miraculously, I stumbled upon an astonishing secret that changed everything.\n\nThe rest is history. Three years later webMethods went public in one of the largest software IPOs ever.\n\nAnd now I want to share this secret with you.\n\nBelieve it or not, most of us spend our lives trapped by the conventional wisdom about success. If you\u2019ve ever read any books about success or attended any seminars or mastermind groups, and yet your life still isn\u2019t turning out the way you thought it would, then maybe you understand what I mean. Even if you\u2019ve never put it in so many words.\n\nYou see, the mind-blowing secret that I want to share with you isn't about conventional wisdom. It's about what\u2019s missing from conventional wisdom. It\u2019s about what\u2019s missing from all the books, seminars, and advice you\u2019ve ever heard about success.\n\nIf you're dying to break free of the conventional results you've been getting from conventional wisdom, then you're in the right place at the right time.\n\nBecause I want to reveal this secret to you in my blockbuster new book: MAGIC QUESTIONS 2.0.\n\nTo learn more visit: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8KP4M5D",

It quickly became the #1 bestselling techno-thriller on the Amazon Kindle and remained on the Top Ten List list for six months.\n\nI enjoyed writing it so much that I couldn't stop tinkering with it, so I revised it twice, and returned to the original working title\u2014NO SECRETS.\n\nVersion 4.0 updates the story one last time. Please understand this is not a sequel, nor is it a fourth volume in a series. NO SECRETS (4.0) is a revision of previous versions, much as software gets revised or the \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut\u201d of a movie creates a more finished product.\n\nHere you\u2019ll find some revised scenes, a new ending, name changes for a couple of characters, a thousand tiny tweaks, and several bug fixes, all intended to provide a better read.\n\nDespite all these changes, if you've read any (or all) of the previous titles one can hardly expect you to read this version. Unless, like I do, you believe that some stories are worth reading again and again.\u2029\n\nHere's the story in a nutshell:\n\nThe NSA is moving mountains to build the world\u2019s first quantum computer, a device so powerful it will give them the means to break into every computer on the planet, and to own every secret. \n\nBut what if a brilliant young scientist beats them to it?\n\nWhat if the NSA tries to steal her device?\n\nWhat if the terrorists get there first?\n\nIf you like action, adventure, compelling characters, and a climax guaranteed to take your breath away\u2014over and over again\u2014then you know why this story became the #1 best-selling technothriller on the Kindle and spent six months on the bestseller list.",

        "description": "My connection with Keith Ellis goes back a number of years and has maintained its vitality and value for several reasons. First and foremost, Keith is the consummate communicator. I've witnessed his facile phone manner and techniques for positive persuasion at work building solid  relationships and winning business many times.\r\n\r\nThroughout many collaborations, I've also come to appreciate how effectively he applies the art of communication across both the spoken, and the written word.  I\u2019ve found that to be a rare and valuable talent and one consistently appreciated by many a satisfied client.  Indeed, Keith manages to do this so well, that his clients appear to embrace and incorporate his professional messages rather than simply focus on them as old school \"sales presentations.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result, Keith creates relationships that last. Connections that build trust. Sales that generate long-term, forecast-ready revenues.  From what I've witnessed over the years, Keith has built a great many stable, and mutually valuable, business relationships due to the fact that he truly believes in serving his clients and seeks to add value at every turn and for every project.  That can be a singularly compelling  package and one I have seen defeat many competitor's attempts to pull apart Keith's business network.\r\n\r\nA veteran of more than 25 years in technology sales management and marketing, I would recommend Keith as a leader and core resource for any BD project. Quite simply, he's got the professional \"chops\" to make profitable new business happen and long-term revenues grow.",

Simple is better. Ideas that are simple for the customer to understand, the staff to execute, and the shareholders to embrace will ultimately result in success.\n\nWhen it comes to accounting, we really need to look to the future. It is no longer necessary to be beholden to the traditional methods.

By removing that layer of unnecessary overhead, we can make financial literacy available and affordable to small businesses and households nationwide.\n\nWith the ability to be completely cloud-based, leverage AI for the grunt work, and fully integrate back office technologies Complete Controller can deliver a personalized, accurate and timely product at an affordable price. Using Jennifer's methods, Complete Controller fulfills direct-to-client services and provides a reliable outsourced turnkey CAS department solution to accounting professionals and firms, allowing them to gain the independence they need and focus on higher revenue services and maintain their independence.\n\nFor those that want to build their own cloud-based professional service business, Jennifer gives away all of her secrets, strategies, bumps, and bruises in her book, From Cubicle to Cloud {pub date January 2021}. For a deep dive into cloud structures, business models, and profit builders.

    "about": "I\u2019ve spent over 20 years leading in tech and biotech organizations through scale and restructuring, including serving as a Global Chief People Officer. I\u2019ve worked inside companies growing from $30M to $5.5B, building leadership teams and operating models under real execution pressure.\n\nI\u2019ve sat in hundreds of leadership meetings where the strategy was sound and the talent was strong, yet progress slowed. What I see repeatedly is leadership systems lagging behind complexity. Directors and VPs absorb friction, decisions resurface, and senior leaders become the point of integration to keep work moving.\n\nThis shows up operationally:\n\u2022 Leaders spending more time coordinating than executing\n\u2022 Decisions revisited across meetings and weeks\n\u2022 Escalations becoming the default path forward\n\nThe cost is slower execution and growing dependence on a small number of senior leaders.\n\nI work with executives to redesign how leadership operates so strategy shows up in decisions, meetings, and follow-through. The work is hands-on and practical. We clarify decision rights, tighten escalation paths, redesign meeting cadence, and reset leadership habits so accountability moves without constant intervention.\n\nClients often turn to me when the pressure is high, the system feels stretched, and the path forward demands both courage and clarity. The goal is not more process, but a leadership system that can carry scale without relying on heroics.\nBeyond my consulting and coaching practice, I serve as a trusted advisor to leaders and teams seeking to reimagine how they work and grow together. \n\nI am an ICF-certified coach and I hold a Ph.D. in Organizational Psychology, an M.A. in Industrial and Social Psychology, and a B.A. in Psychology\n\nContact Shirley at Shirley@Swift-Insights.com\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Shirley@Swift-Insights.com",

Companies have undertaken a multitude of initiatives to remedy the problem. The outcomes of these efforts have been mixed, and the under-representation of professional SET women continues to grow. In this research study, I set forth a mixed-method research design to examine the correlates of SET organization managers\u2019 intentions related to hiring, developing, and retaining SET women. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) was used to assess and predict SET managers\u2019 intentions to engage in Women-Friendly Behaviors (WFB) toward SET women.",

Shirley is an incredibly strong, passionate and driven leader who brings a wealth of HR experience and knowledge. While we were at Zadara, she was responsible for developing a world class organization. She was focused on providing talent management,  organizational development, HR Operations & On Boarding, Recruitment, Compensation, HR Business Partnership, Training, Learning & Development, and building a positive employee experience to form a strong culture across the globe.  \n\nWhile working together at Zadara, we had to scale and grow very quickly in a short period of time. In addition, she had to lead our team through change management; development of new processes, build system enhancements & integrations to name a few. As a fearless leader, she lead our team throughout these changes and allowed her direct team to lead and manage their specific functions. She provided autonomy to me while being a constant advocate for me. She encouraged me to think out of the box and to be innovative. In fact, this is one of her many strengths. \n\nShe has this innate ability to think strategically on a global level to truly transform and drive our organization to a higher level of performance.  While she is very strategic, she was also very hands on and is not afraid to jump in and solve an issue. She knows how to partner with her executives and board members to coach them through challenging situations.  \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed working with Shirley and would love to work with her again! She would be an asset to any organization as she is extremely dedicated, loyal and  will drive any HR team to achieve the highest level of success.",

I worked with Taylor approximately eight years ago, and even then, she stood out as an exceptionally capable and motivated professional.\n\nWhen Taylor joined the team, she quickly demonstrated a keen ability to understand the complexities of clinical trial management, navigate challenges with ease, and foster productive collaboration across multidisciplinary teams. Her attention to detail and ability to prioritize and execute tasks effectively were instrumental in the smooth running of several clinical trials during her tenure.\n\nWithin a relatively short time, Taylor distinguished herself by consistently exceeding expectations within her role. Her proactive attitude, strong problem-solving skills, and ability to build trust with sponsors, stakeholders, and team members made her an invaluable asset. It was no surprise that she was quickly promoted to Project Manager after proving her competency for the role.\n\nI have no doubt that she will continue to excel in her career. Please reach out if you have further questions regarding our time working together. \n\nRobert Weldon",

I was on autopilot, until desperation nudged me to mention a fresh industry trend I\u2019d read about that morning. \n\nSuddenly, she sat up, fired off questions, and\u2014just like that\u2014we had a real conversation. Deal closed. \n\nLesson learned:\u00a0Stories tailored to your audience actually matter. If you\u2019ve ever watched a promising prospect mentally check out during your pitch, you know the pain of generic messaging.\u00a0It\u2019s like showing up at a masquerade in sweatpants\u2014forgettable and definitely not a contender for best dressed.\n\nBuyers can spot a cookie-cutter approach instantly. Miss the mark, and your message fades into the background, like elevator music no one remembers.  I needed something to help us break through the noise\u2014a secret weapon.\n\nEnter AI: Your Data-Driven Storytelling Sidekick\n\nNot the sci-fi, take-over-the-world kind of AI\u2014the helpful, data-crunching kind that helps you sound more\u00a0human, not less. \n\nWe let AI dig into mountains of buyer data\u2014who they are, what they care about, what keeps them up at night.\n\nBut here\u2019s the secret sauce:\u00a0AI delivers the insights, but it\u2019s your team\u2019s creativity that turns them into memorable stories.\n\nThink of AI as the sous chef, prepping the best ingredients. Your people are the chefs, crafting the perfect dish. Instead of the usual \u201chere\u2019s how awesome our product is!\u201d approach, we started sharing stories about real businesses and real impact. Engagement soared.\n\nBuyers want to hear about their challenges, not just your features. We shifted our narrative, and suddenly, we weren\u2019t just another vendor\u2014we became trusted partners. That big deal? Signed, sealed, and delivered\u2014with a little extra on top.\n\nI\u2019m not claiming AI is some magic wand, but it\u2019s a powerful flashlight when you\u2019re lost in a maze of buyer uncertainty.\n\nAI is your GPS\u2014you still have to drive the car.\u00a0The best stories blend data and heart, and trust me, it\u2019s way more effective than reciting the same tired deck.",

        "postText": "Sales Has Changed: Are You Keeping Up?\u00a0\u00a0\nSuccess in sales depends less on what you say and more on\u00a0how you make people feel.\u00a0This is where\u00a0Emotional Intelligence (EI)\u00a0becomes your ultimate advantage. It is not just another buzzword\u2014it is the competitive edge that separates\u00a0good sales professionals\u00a0from\u00a0exceptional ones.\n\nHere is a\u00a05-step Emotional Intelligence framework\u2014designed to help you stand out, build trust, and drive meaningful results.\n\nThe 5-Step Emotional Intelligence Framework for Sales Success\n1. Master Self-Awareness: Set the Right Tone\nThe most exceptional sales professionals know that success begins with self-awareness. Before every interaction, ask yourself:\nWhat energy am I bringing into this conversation?\nAm I calm, confident, and focused\u2014or stressed and distracted?\nQuick Tip:\u00a0Before your next call or meeting, take a moment to reset. Whether it is a deep breath, or a pause to refocus, being mindful of your emotional state can make all the difference.\n\n2. Build Trust Through Empathy\nEmpathy is more than just a skill\u2014it is the foundation of every successful relationship. When you take the time to truly understand your prospect\u2019s challenges, goals, and pain points, you stop being just another salesperson and start becoming a trusted partner.\nQuick Tip:\u00a0During your next conversation, try reflecting back what your prospect says. For example:\n\u201cIt sounds like your biggest challenge right now is\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI can tell how frustrating [specific pain point] must be for you.\u201d\n\n3. Speak Without Words: Master Non-Verbal Communication\nDid you know that\u00a093% of communication is non-verbal?\u00a0Your tone, body language, and facial expressions send powerful signals to your prospects.\nQuick Tip:\u00a0Pay attention to these non-verbal cues:\nPosture:\u00a0Are you sitting upright and engaged, or slumped and distracted?\nTone:\u00a0Does your voice convey warmth, confidence, and enthusiasm?\nFacial Expressions:\u00a0Are you smiling (even during virtual calls)?\n\n4. Navigate Objections with Emotional Intelligence\nObjections are inevitable, but how you handle them defines your ability to close the deal. Emotional Intelligence helps you approach objections with\u00a0calm, patience, and creativity.\nQuick Tip:\u00a0When faced with an objection, follow this 3-step process:\nAcknowledge:\u00a0\u201cThat is a great point. I can understand why you might feel that way.\u201d\nClarify:\u00a0\u201cCan you share more about what\u2019s behind this concern?\u201d\nSolve:\u00a0Offer a solution tailored to their specific needs.\n\n5. Strengthen Relationships with Post-Sale Care\nThe real work begins after the deal closes.\u00a0Emotional Intelligence does not stop when the contract is signed.\u00a0Building loyalty, retaining clients, and turning customers into advocates requires ongoing care.\u00a0\nQuick Tip:\u00a0After a sale, schedule a follow-up email or call\u2014not to pitch anything, but simply to check in. Ask:\n\u201cHow are things going with [product/service]?\u201d\n\u201cIs there anything else I can help you with?\u201d\n\nWhat strategies have worked for you, and what challenges have you faced?",

Do you play offensively, aiming to dominate the board, or defensively, protecting your position?\nBut here\u2019s the real question: Are you approaching sales and marketing like a chess game\u2014or just winging it?\n\n\nThe Challenge: Disconnected Moves Lead to Lost Games\nOne of the biggest mistakes in business is treating sales and marketing as separate silos instead of a unified force working toward a shared goal.\n\nHere\u2019s what happens when there\u2019s no alignment:\n\u2022 Missed Opportunities:\u00a0Marketing generates high-quality leads, but sales doesn\u2019t have the tools or strategy to nurture and close them.\n\u2022 Short-Term Thinking:\u00a0Sales focuses on immediate wins, ignoring the long-term brand-building foundation laid by marketing.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like playing chess without a strategy: moving pieces aimlessly and hoping for the best. Without a cohesive plan, your business risks falling into \u201ccheckmate.\u201d\nTo win the game, you need alignment, foresight, and a clear strategy.\n\nActionable Insights: Play the Game Strategically\nIf you want your sales and marketing efforts to work in harmony\u2014like a well-played chess game\u2014here are five strategic moves to implement:\n\n1. Start with the Endgame in Mind\nGreat chess players visualize checkmate before making their first move. Similarly, your teams must align on shared goals. Whether it\u2019s boosting ROI or expanding market share having a clear endgame ensures everyone is working toward the same vision.\n\n2. Position Your Pieces (Your Team and Tools)\nEvery chess piece has a role. Marketing is your opening strategy (creating awareness, like pawns advancing), while sales makes the decisive moves (queens and rooks closing deals). Invest in tools like CRMs and analytics platforms to ensure seamless collaboration across teams.\n\n3. Anticipate Your Opponent\u2019s Moves\nChess champions study their opponents. Your teams should do the same\u2014study your audience and competitors. Use data to predict customer pain points, objections, and preferences. The better your understanding, the sharper your strategy.\n\n4. Adapt and Pivot Mid-Game\nNo chess match or business strategy goes perfectly as planned. Monitor your campaigns and sales performance closely. If something isn\u2019t working, be agile. Pivoting strategically can often mean the difference between winning and losing.\n\n5. Play the Long Game\nChess isn\u2019t won in a single move, and neither is customer loyalty. Marketing builds trust and awareness over time, while sales delivers personalized value-driven interactions. Together, they create a sustainable growth engine for long-term success.\n\nAre You Playing to Win?\nSales and marketing, like chess, require strategy, collaboration, and patience. When these two forces align, your business becomes a powerhouse.\nDrop your strategies in the comments below.",

        "postText": "From Pain Points to Solutions: A Salesperson\u2019s Guide to Delivering Value\nTo succeed, sales professionals must move beyond selling and become\u00a0trusted problem solvers\u00a0who deeply understand and address their clients\u2019 unique challenges. Here\u2019s how:\n\nWhy Pain Points Matter\nPain points are the daily frustrations, inefficiencies, or obstacles your clients face. \n\ud83d\udca5When you solve these pain points, you become a trusted advisor. Ignore them, and your pitch risks becoming irrelevant.\n\nStep 1\ufe0f\u20e3: Identify Client Needs\nA successful sales presentation starts with understanding your client\u2019s priorities and challenges.\na)\u00a0Do Your Homework\nResearch their company, industry, and competitors before the meeting. Look for:\nTrends or challenges impacting their business.\nInsights from their website, press releases, or LinkedIn.\nb)\u00a0Ask Open-Ended Questions\nStrategic questions reveal challenges and goals. Examples:\n\u201cWhat obstacles are preventing you from achieving your goals?\u201d\n\u201cHow does your team define success this quarter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat tools or processes aren\u2019t meeting expectations?\u201d\nThese questions uncover pain points while showing genuine interest in their success.\nc)\u00a0Actively Listen\nActive listening is a sales superpower. Pay attention to verbal and non-verbal cues\u2014like frustration about inefficiencies or enthusiasm about goals\u2014to guide your pitch.\n\nStep 2\ufe0f\u20e3: Provide Tailored Solutions\nOnce you\u2019ve identified pain points, position your product or service as the solution.\na)\u00a0Customize Your Presentation\nGeneric presentations won\u2019t cut it. Tailor your pitch to their specific challenges. For example:\nIf inefficiencies are the issue, show how your solution streamlines processes.\nIf costs are a concern, highlight ROI and long-term savings.\nUse case studies or real-world examples to help them visualize the impact of your solution.\nb)\u00a0Focus on Benefits, Not Features\nClients care about outcomes, not technical details. Frame your product in terms of value. For example:\nInstead of, \u201cOur software automates reporting,\u201d say, \u201cOur software reduces reporting time by 50%, freeing up your team for strategic work.\u201d\nHighlight how your solution directly addresses their pain points and drives results.\nc)\u00a0Address Objections Early\nObjections are natural\u2014address them proactively.\nIf cost is a concern, explain ROI and long-term value.\nIf implementation feels daunting, outline your onboarding process and support resources.\nProactively tackling objections builds trust and confidence in your solution.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Empathy Is Your Greatest Tool\n\ud83d\udca5Sales isn\u2019t about flashy pitches\u2014it\u2019s about empathy. Clients don\u2019t buy products. They buy solutions to their problems and outcomes that make their lives easier.",

        "postText": "How Pixar\u2019s Storytelling Principles Can Transform Your Sales Strategy\n\nEvery sale begins with a story. And when it comes to storytelling, Pixar has mastered the art of creating emotional and compelling narratives. Pixar\u2019s storytelling magic isn\u2019t just for movies\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer for sales.\n\nSales isn\u2019t just about pitching a product. It\u2019s about building trust, creating emotional connections, and helping your prospects see themselves as the hero of the story. \n\n1. Your Prospect Is the Hero \nPixar\u2019s stories always center around a relatable hero who faces challenges and embarks on a journey. In sales, your prospect is the hero, not your product.\n\nSales Lesson:\u00a0Frame your pitch around your prospect\u2019s challenges and goals. Instead of focusing on what your product does, focus on how it helps them overcome their struggles. \u201cYou\u2019re juggling multiple tasks, and it\u2019s overwhelming. Imagine having a tool that simplifies your day and gives you back hours of your time.\u201d\n\nWhen your prospect sees themselves in the story, they\u2019re more likely to engage.\n\n2. Introduce the Conflict\nEvery Pixar movie has a conflict that drives the story forward. In sales, the conflict is the problem your prospect is facing.\n\nSales Lesson:\u00a0Highlight the pain points your prospect is experiencing. Be specific. \u201cYour team is spending 10 hours a week manually entering data, which is slowing down your growth.\u201d\n\nWhen you articulate the problem clearly, your prospect will feel understood.\n\n3. Be the Guide, Not the Hero\nIn Pixar movies, the hero doesn\u2019t succeed alone\u2014they have a guide. In sales, you\u2019re the guide who helps your prospect overcome their challenges.\n\nSales Lesson:\u00a0Position your product as the tool that empowers your prospect to succeed. Show them how it solves their problem and leads to their desired outcome. \u201cWith our software, you\u2019ll eliminate manual data entry, save 10 hours a week, and focus on growing your business.\u201d\n\nYour role is to guide them toward success, not to take the spotlight.\n\n4. Use Emotion to Drive Action\nPixar\u2019s stories are emotional. Why? Because emotion drives action. The same is true in sales.\n\nSales Lesson:\u00a0Don\u2019t just rely on logic and data\u2014tap into your prospect\u2019s emotions. Use vivid language to describe the relief they\u2019ll feel when they achieve their goals. \u201cImagine the relief of knowing your team has everything they need to succeed, without the stress of manual processes.\u201d\n\nEmotion creates a connection, and connection drives decisions.\n\n5. Show the Transformation\nPixar movies always end with a transformation. In sales, the transformation is the outcome your prospect achieves with your product.\n\nSales Lesson:\u00a0Paint a clear picture of the \u201cbefore and after.\u201d \u201cBefore using our solution, one of our clients struggled to meet deadlines. After implementing it, they reduced project delays by 30% and increased customer satisfaction by 20%.\u201d\n\nWhen your prospect can visualize the transformation, they\u2019ll be more motivated to take action.",

Systems that create clarity, enable accountability, and allow people to perform at their highest level when the pressure is on.\n\nLeading teams in complex, high-risk environments has taught me that execution excellence is never accidental. It\u2019s the result of alignment, rhythm, and disciplined leadership. My focus is helping organizations scale leadership, not just output \u2014 delivering operational reliability, cultural strength, and financial performance in equal measure.\n\nMy Leadership Framework\n\t1.\tClarity over complexity \u2013 Confusion is expensive. The best leaders simplify direction until everyone understands why the work matters.\n\t2.\tCulture is a system, not a slogan \u2013 Values don\u2019t live on walls; they live in behavior. Culture becomes real when it\u2019s designed, measured, and reinforced daily.\n\t3.\tAccountability creates freedom \u2013 Accountability isn\u2019t control; it\u2019s ownership. Empowered teams make faster, smarter decisions when they know what success looks like.\n\t4.\tProcess protects performance \u2013 Discipline wins when stakes are high. Systems and routines keep teams consistent when conditions change.\n\t5.\tCalm is a competitive advantage \u2013 Pressure exposes preparation. Great leaders create stability by modeling composure when it matters most.\n\nMy work centers on leadership systems, operational strategy, scalable performance, culture development, and cross-industry growth execution \u2014 all grounded in disciplined financial performance and long-term value creation.\n\nUltimately, my purpose is to help organizations build operational cultures that last \u2014 the kind that deliver consistent results across industries, borders, and generations of leaders",

Most days, the circle you can actually trust is small.\n\nI know this because I have sat across from more than 10,000 executives as their career coach and recruiter.\n\nHere is what separates the most successful:\n\nThey learn how to build, maintain, and leverage trust.\n\nThey maximize ROI of their time. \n\nThey invest early in the right relationships and give those people the clear language to advocate for them when it matters.\n\nEveryone else networks at random and ends up busy, burnt out, and unsure why momentum keeps stalling.\n\nAt senior levels, outcomes are shaped by an identifiable, small number of relationships, not by effort or visibility alone.\n\nThe leaders who move fastest tend to have five types of people in their corner:\n\t1.\tChampions who vouch for them in rooms they are not in\n\t2.\tConnectors who open the right doors at the right time\n\t3.\tCollaborators who sharpen thinking and execution\n\t4.\tChallengers who surface blind spots before they become problems\n\t5.\tConfidants who keep them grounded under pressure\n\nThese relationships reduce decision fatigue.\nThey improve judgment.\nThey create leverage.\n\nThat is my work.\n\nI help executives see the relationship patterns shaping their outcomes, especially the ones that are invisible from the inside.\n\nOver time, this has become a system.\n\nA way to make sense of networks that feel scattered, underused, or stuck.\n\nIt is built on a few simple truths:\n\nNot all relationships serve the same purpose.\nInfluence moves through small trust circles.\nYour network can only advocate for you if you have given them the right words.\n\nThe system combines:\n\t\u2022\tFive distinct relationship roles\n\t\u2022\tA clear view of your Network\u2019s Networth \n\t\u2022\tSix dimensions that give your network accurate, referral-ready language\n\t\u2022\tAn activation lens that matches the problem to the right relationship\n\nThis is not just about expanding your network.\n\nIt is about using the trust you already have with more intention.\n\nThe leaders I work with stop guessing.\nThey stop over-indexing on recruiters.\nThey stop having vague career conversations that go nowhere.\n\nThey become easier to name.\nEasier to recommend.\nEasier to trust.\n\nNo noise.\nNo posturing.\nNo wasted time.\n\nJust a clear system for turning trust into momentum.\n\nIf you want to make better decisions, spend time with people who speak from futures they have already survived.",

From the moment I met Bea, her unique blend of strategic vision, executive empathy and network-building prowess stood out. Bea has an uncanny ability to bring together C-suite leaders from diverse industries and create a community where knowledge, authenticity and high-integrity leadership flourish.\n\nThroughout her work with SuiteC she has consistently demonstrated:\n\nVisionary community-building \u2013 Bea built SuiteC around a powerful insight: senior executives are often isolated, and what they need most is a peer-driven forum of trust, candor and strategic growth. The structure she\u2019s created provides exactly that. \n\nExecutive insight paired with real-world application \u2013 She doesn\u2019t just convene; she curates. The programs, think-tanks and roundtables she leads are business-first, outcome-oriented and time-efficient, respecting the demands on high-performing leaders. \nsuitecllc.com\n\nIntegrity and authenticity \u2013 Bea models what she asks of others: a high EQ, a commitment to excellence, a willingness to challenge the status quo while lifting those around her. Her leadership inspires trust and encourages bold growth.\n\nImpactful results \u2013 Participants in SuiteC walk away not just with ideas but with connections, accountability partners, strategic clarity and momentum. The value-creation is real.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone who not only envisions what\u2019s next in executive leadership and peer networks but also delivers it, Bea is that person. I wholeheartedly endorse her and look forward to seeing the next chapter of what she builds.\n\nWelcome to SuiteC\nsuitecllc.com",

Through her inquisitive skills and insight, Bea understood my objectives and requirements as completely, and as in depth as those of her client (the employer).   Because the opportunity was many states away, clarity here was a critical \u2018need to have\u2019.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHow do Beatriz and Vaco distinguish themselves?  First, Bea exhibits energy and tenacity bar none \u2013 for example, as her client experienced organizational changes, Bea followed-up with me with appropriate frequency to communicate the environment along with the continued client needs.  Secondly and most importantly, beyond her insight and persistence, Bea stands out among recruiters because of her straightforward communication and integrity.  She speaks to the objective facts about companies, positions, and rewards \u2013 properly setting expectations for all.  When I had specific questions about the employer, without hesitation, Bea provided sound timely responses.  Third, as an experienced finance professional with only the best education and financial acumen, Bea outshines others because she speaks finance and business perspicuously.  Bea \u2018gets it\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving worked with recruiters as both a hiring manager and as a candidate, I know, without a doubt, that Bea is in a unique class as she drives for a truly successful match between employer and employee.  I look forward to working with her and Vaco on future requisitions.",

        "source": "Homeland Security Today",
        "summary": "Dr. Yann LeCun, Meta\u2019s Chief AI Scientist, argues that the current focus on scaling large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally misguided if our goal is human-level intelligence. In a recent NVIDIA GTC talk, he proposed that \u201cworld models\u201d\u2014self-supervised, multimodal systems built on Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs)\u2014offer a more promising path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike LLMs, which are limited to discrete text tokens and lack persistent memory, true reasoning, planning, or interaction with the physical world, world models learn by predicting and simulating real-world dynamics across text, images, audio, and video. Rooted in work by David Ha, J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, Fei-Fei Li, and others, these architectures mimic how humans build internal representations\u2014observing, categorizing, and anticipating outcomes\u2014without relying on massive, labeled datasets. LeCun envisions a hybrid future in which LLMs handle language tasks while world models drive robotics, autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and national-security applications by \u201creading the room,\u201d reasoning about consequences, and executing complex physical tasks\u2014ultimately reshaping our approach to AI development and edging us closer to AGI.",

    "about": "I help sales professionals hit BIG numbers and connect with their clients to move them from status quo/do nothing, to closed with impact.  \n\nAnd do so... with more personal ease, joy, and connection. \n\nThis is where Top 1% Sales Results Meet Science. \n\nSales and the buyer's journey are changing and innovation in the sales arena is needed to both connect with buyers, but also increase the wellbeing of anyone selling. \n\nThe great news is that the approach is game-changing, easily applied, and can be done in the moment of the deal. \n\nI would describe myself as a research geek\u2014obsessed with the science behind what actually works at scale and applying tools in the moment of the deal vs theory. I spend my time creating insights that combine both in-the-trenches experience with science. I research how people actually buy. What reduces buying friction and seller bias. How our brains work under pressure. What makes hard things easier instead of just harder.\n\nI've been in the sales trenches for 32 years, 3x #1 WW, sold the largest deals in company history 3x, broke barriers and set records at each position and company along my career, scaling best practices, innovating approaches, and selling over $250M. \n\nI was known for increasing deal size and decreasing time to close and doing it by working smarter, not harder. \n\nI've also spent time in sales enablement building growth programs. Testing them. Scaling them. The result? \n\nReps in my programs closed at 43% vs rest of the company at 8%. Same product. Same market. Different human approach.\n\nNow I've created the Creator of The Multiplier Method\u2122 & the Million Dollar W2\u2122 Sales system. \n\nIt's about helping sales pros and teams Work Smarter, Not Harder. \nA three-pronged approach based in behavioral science, behavioral economics, neuroscience, peak performance, positive psychology, and more. \n\nIt's where streetwise meets science and engineers sales systems and approaches that work to create greater sales numbers while also creating greater health, wealth, and relationship success for both the sales pro and their company. \n\nI care deeply about purpose, impact, elevating the sales profession, and making a difference - at work, home, and in the world. \n\nI've partnered with B1G1 so that when something good happens at work, something great happens in the world. To me, this partnership is about making the world better while building sales lives and careers. \n\nIf working smarter and not harder resonates, join me in my newsletter: https://multipliers.mattersofgrowth.com/newsletter\n\nOr reach out for a DM and let's talk.",

        "title": "The effects of bupropion on autonomic response to mental stress",
        "source": "American College of Clinical Pharmacy",
        "summary": "PURPOSE: The chemical structure of bupropion is related to amphetamine,\nthus, it may have cardiovascular stimulatory properties. This study examined\nthe effects of acute administration of bupropion on autonomic response in\nhumans before, during, and after voluntary subjection to mental stress.\nMETHODS: Healthy, adult volunteers were eligible for this double-blind,\ncrossover, placebo-controlled, single-center pilot study. Subjects were\nrandomized to receive sustained-release bupropion titrated to 150 mg twice\ndaily over 7 days, or corresponding placebo, with a three day wash-out period\nbetween treatments. After each treatment period, each subject underwent a 2-\nhour clinic visit, where separate speech and math \u201cstress\u201d tests were\nadministered. Heart rate was recorded every minute, and plasma\ncatecholamines were measured before, during and after each stress test.\nRESULTS: Twelve subjects participated in this study. Average heart rates were\nsignificantly higher after bupropion versus placebo 30 minutes prior to\nspeech test administration (74 vs 65, p<0.0003), while subjects listened to\ntheir recorded speech, (83 vs 73, p<0.008), and 15 minutes after speech and\nmath tests (81 vs 75, p<0.007). Plasma norepinephrine serum levels were\nsignificantly higher in subjects after taking bupropion versus placebo during\nspeech test administration, (260 \u00b1 100 vs 207 \u00b1 124 pg/ml, p<0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Autonomic response to mental stress was greater after\ntreatment with bupropion for 7 days than placebo. These alterations in heart\nrate and plasma norepinephrine levels may be detrimental in patients at\nincreased risk for cardiovascular disease. Further studies are necessary to\nestablish definitive effects of bupropion on hemodynamic variables and the\npotential clinical consequences.\n",

It is about anticipating the future. \n\nBy defining the \"why,\" you define your organization's overarching purpose and long-term direction.\n\nAsk:\n\ud83d\udd38 What are the trends, challenges, and opportunities? \n\ud83d\udd38 What trends could impact our industry or organization?\n\ud83d\udd38 Why should we pursue markets, products, or services over others?\n\ud83d\udd38 Is our current mission/vision relevant, and how does it need to evolve?\n\ud83d\udd38 What risks or opportunities could arise, and how should we prepare for them?\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 STRATEGIC THINKING - THE HOW:\u00a0\nHow will you and the organization compete effectively in your markets? \n\nStrategic thinking involves analyzing the competitive environment, understanding customer needs, and crafting unique value propositions.\n\nStrategic thinking is about gaining a competitive edge by translating foresight into actionable strategies that define how the business will achieve its objectives.\n\nAsk:\n\ud83d\udd38 How can we differentiate ourselves from competitors?\n\ud83d\udd38 How will our strategies address changes in customer needs?\n\ud83d\udd38 How do we leverage our strengths to capitalize on opportunities and respond to competitive threats?\n\ud83d\udd38 How can we foster innovation to stay ahead in the marketplace?\n\ud83d\udd38 What are we not seeing?\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 STRATEGIC PLANNING - THE WHAT:\n\nAs a leader, you must think through your operations (marketing, HR, sales, finance, etc.) to ensure alignment with business objectives.\n\nThe \"what\" consists of specific activities, resources, and timelines to execute the business strategy.\n\nAsk:\n\ud83d\udd38 What specific actions are needed to achieve our strategic objectives?\n\ud83d\udd38 What resources are required to execute successfully?\n\ud83d\udd38 What are the timelines and milestones needed to execute?\n\ud83d\udd38 What metrics will we use to measure progress/success?\n\ud83d\udd38 What contingencies are needed in case things don't go as planned?\n\nWhere does strategy fail the most?

What I discovered is it's NOT only one thing that makes a person successful; it is a combination of things that they apply that does.\n\nLet's confirm what you already know.\n\nWe all get 24 hours in a day. But you, like most high achievers, get more done in 2 hours than most people get done in a day, and maybe even a week.\n\nAnd, like most high-achievers, you don't suffer burnout. You may try to get too much done and get frazzled, but that's when you step back and use one of the 9 tools below. \n\nThe infographic should be titled BUILDING MOMENTUM FOR A GREAT LIFE. The tools in the infographic help you reprioritize your life to align with what you want and make work fun.\n\nThe tools can be used to coach yourself. Here's how I use them when coaching others: \n\n1. DECIDE TO BECOME EXCELLENT. Once you are excellent, you never have to worry about losing your job or money again. This is a game-changer. \n\n2. THE MINDSET SHIFT. Cultivate a growth mindset. See life and work as a big game, a learning experience.\n\n3. THE BIG GAME APPROACH. This doesn't mean you don't take your work seriously; just don't take yourself too seriously. \n\n4. REFRAME EVENTS. See your work, associated tasks, victories, and setbacks as fun and learning experiences. Yes. You are becoming a high achiever, and as a high achiever, you will suffer setbacks - but you know that since you are already a high achiever.\n\n5. CHALLENGE YOURSELF. See how much you can do better than yesterday. Set little goals and targets: \"Let's see if I can beat yesterday's number.\"\n\n6. DON'T COMPARE. Remember, comparison to others is a trap. \n\n7. ABSORB MATERIAL AND APPLY. You get more ideas by applying new material quickly, testing the ideas, and adapting them to your style.\n\n8. CREATE INCREMENTAL DIFFERENCES. You don't have to have gigantic improvements. Look for the more minor, incremental differences.\n\n9. BUILD MOMENTUM. Use incremental differences (#8\u00a0above) to build momentum. Momentum is like compound interest. It becomes a powerful \"Snowball effect.\"\n\n10. USE TOOLS AND STRATEGIES. Learn to use each tool in the infographic below to gain and keep that positive momentum to move you forward. I know I do, and they have changed my life and the lives of countless others.\n____________________\nThis is one of the training sessions I put on for executives and high potential managers over Zoom and in person. It is one of the most popular sessions due to the competing priorities managers and frontline workers are faced with daily.\n\nIf you are interested in how I do these sessions contact me: joe@josephbmurphy.com\n___________________\n\n\u2795 Join me in my quest for higher levels of performance\n\ud83d\udd14 Ring the bell for new posts\n\ud83c\udf1f Cool to repost\n\n#reinventyourself\n#highachievers\n#potential\n#mastery\n\nInfographic: agrassoblog.org",

It doesn't have to be 3 or 4 days of classes.\n\n90-\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc19\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2c\nI work with several organizations where I facilitate leadership sessions several times a week. These sessions bring people together to learn lessons from industry experts and the organization's most experienced people so people who are on the frontline can discuss what they did to be successful.\n\nThe sessions are lively, authentic, and informative. People come away with at least 2 or 3 things to implement immediately and they do!\n\nBringing people with 30 days of experience with people with 30 years of experience produces a powerful bond. People see each other differently. It builds camaraderie and reinforces a collaborative culture.\n\n\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c:\n1) PROFITS AND RETENTION\nThese organizations produce more profits, revenue, and results, and retention rates are unreal compared to the industry.\n\n2) TRUST AND PRIORITIES\nPeople prioritize their work to get results, and this alignment creates a bond of trust between managers and staff.\n\n3) PRODUCTIVITY, GROWTH, AND EXCITEMENT\nImagine working in an office where there is no conflict, everyone is rowing in the same direction, and people are enthusiastic about learning and developing their talents to the full. Is this possible?\n\n4) LIFE SKILLS\nSurveys report that these sessions not only help people do their work better in the office but also, more amazingly, that people report their home life is better. People are taking the lessons home to teach their spouses and children!!\n\nTalk about a competitive advantage in the hiring marketplace.\n\nThe skills in the infographic are an excellent start for teaching and coaching others.

If something happens once between you and someone else, notice it. \n- You don't make it a big deal, but you do make a note of it.\n- You may say to myself, \u201cWell, I had an emotional response to that, or something didn\u2019t seem right.\u201d\n\n2. If it happens again, you wonder if there is a pattern.\n- You notice it once again, but your antennae is up.\n\n3. The third time it happens, you make sure you have a conversation with the person\n- You know if you don't have the conversation it's going to come out in some way that you won't be your best self\n- If you wait past the third time, it will be more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nThe next step \n\n\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb - \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddec\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02 \ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddfc \ud835\udddc\ud835\ude01?\n\n1. The most important thing you can do is to get into a listening mode. \n2. Obviously, when you decide to have the difficult conversation you have something to say. You have to resist the urge to say something.\n3. What you do here is take a deep breath, and ask the person a question. Ask, \"Can you tell me what your intention was when you said XYZ?\"\n4. The best thing you could do in a hard-to-have conversation is let the other person speak.\n_____________________\nWhen you allow the person to speak . . . Here's What Happens:\n- When they speak, their defensiveness goes down and so does yours.\n- You both are starting to relax because you are open and listening. \n- You are actually hearing what the person has to say.\n- You\u2019re also picking up some pretty useful information about what they meant and/or how they felt.\n_____________________\n\n5. You repeat back what you heard and ask \"Did I get what you said?\"\n6. After they say, \"Yes, that's it,\" you say: \"Let me give you a sense as to what\u2019s going on for me.\u201d\n\nSo you always want to start with a question. \n\nThen it\u2019s going to be a conversation and not two people yelling at each other. They\u2019re going to be able to hear what you have to say and the results will more than likely be productive. \n\nYour partner in success, Joe Murphy\n\n\ud83d\udce3Cool to repost\n\ud83d\udd14Follow me for more success tips\n\n#TheLeadershipAcademy #DifficultConversations #LeadersatAllLevels\n\n\u23f0 Join me at 5 PM ET for the daily video on leadership, management, and success.

Nor does success and living a good life come from luck. Success in any discipline comes from a steady, calm approach to living a life by design once the person has decided to create a vision of what he wants and pursues it. The decision to pursue this vision of the future and using the vision to design to one\u2019s life in order to achieve it is the beginning of change, and ultimately, transformation.\n\n--> Top performers know what they want, and they have developed a greater ability to focus on the steps and actions needed to pursue their vision.\n      \n--> Top performers use a vision of what they want to create an overarching strategy that guides their actions and behaviors.\n          \nLIVING BY DESIGN IS A PRACTICAL GUIDE to developing effective strategies that, if applied consistently, will transform how you live and help you attain your goals and aspirations. By developing new thinking skills, you will learn to develop a new self-concept of who you think you are and allow you to become everything you were designed to be. \n\nDO THESE CONCEPTS WORK? Yes. I have been using these concepts to help people achieve self-mastery, become more authentic, realize their goals, and in a spiritual sense, live their lives as intended, by design. \n  \nMY AIM IS to teach you the key principles used by people who have achieved mastery so you can tap into your hidden talents and discover the inner genius within you by helping your RETHINK HOW YOU THINK and CREATE a NEW LIFE -- A LIFE BY DESIGN -- YOUR DESIGN",

When she says she is going to do something, she does it. When she commits to a task, she drives it to completion. Kathy is a good communicator - she follows up and sets clear expectations. While she does all this, she does it with professional courtesy and a style that is collaborative.  And all the people I have interviewed rave about her. When I have a recruiting need I call Kathy.",

You have the respect of your peers.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest about the cost.\n\nYou're trading your life for a paycheck. \nYou're answering emails at dinner. \nYou're squeezing your \"real life\" into two days a weekend.\n\nYou're rich in money, but you're poor in time.\n\nI know this because I lived it.\n\nI spent 25 years leading $150M+ sales teams for Oracle, HP, and Workday. \nI had the 100K bonuses and stock options. The \"perfect\" career.\n\nBut I realized I didn't own my success. I rented it.\n\nSo I left.\n\nI didn't retire. I just changed the business model. \nI stopped selling my time to a corporation and started selling my wisdom to the market.\n\nNow, I live a dual life between Europe and North Carolina. I work on my terms. \nAnd I help high-performing leaders (VPs, Directors, CxOs) do exactly the same.\n\nYour experience is an asset.\n\nBut right now, you are selling it at a discount.\n\nI help you fix that. We build your exit on three pillars:\n\n\ud83d\udccc The Exit: How to leave your role without losing your income level.\n\ud83d\udccc The Offer: How to package 20 years of experience into a 5-figure advisory retainer.\n\ud83d\udccc The Life: How to build a business that supports your life with more free time, meaningful work, family and friends, moving your body, travel, or pursing hobbies.\n\nYou don't need to start over. You just need to package what you already know.\n\nMy Background:\n\n- Ex-SaaS Sales Director (Oracle, HP, Workday)\n- Italian-American dual citizen (Living the lifestyle I teach)\n- Guided 115+ leaders to freedom\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Ready to own your time? \n\nCheck the Featured Section.",

Nobody hires a business coach for that! That's like having diabetes and the doctor prescribes Twinkies. So, I was hesitant to spend even more money, yet, I knew something was \"off\" in my coaching business that needed to be addressed. I wasn't consistently generating revenue, and I felt wishy washy inside, unsure of how to position myself and niche down. I was torn by whether I should be a career coach or a life coach.\nOne day on a call Melina spotted it and said, \"Curt, you know you really light up when you talk about the life and mindset stuff.\" \nThat is what I was feeling, but couldn't quite name it. \nWhere Melina helped me that the other coaches did not is getting deeper down, finding those hidden \"things\" that hold us back.  Or, to put it another way, she helped me peel back the layers of the onion completely. \nNow, I feel more confident and secure in everything from my positioning, niche, sales, well, everything.  She gave me those missing pieces that nobody else could. \nI highly recommend Melina, and would hire her again. Put it this way, I stayed on for an additional two months if that says anything.\nCurt Sassak\nFormer chef turned life and career strategist",

We started working together in February. \n\nI really enjoyed his approach. He took the time to learn about me, explain things, what I wanted to represent, who my ideal clients were, and my goals.  He even went above and beyond our initial engagement to help me with my writing and positioning.  \n\nHe wanted me to WIN. \n\nWhat he delivered was nothing short of remarkable.  I loved every single thing--my banner, featured, and content assets. You're seeing it all now on my profile!  Even 3 months later, I'm still creating content using all of the branding elements he provided, and I want more!\n\nThe results speak for themselves:\n\n-I grew 4,000 followers in 2.5 months\n-I started attracting inbound leads from my ICP\n-I increased my prices, and working on my first group offer\n\nIf you're on the fence about hiring him, time to jump off and go for it already.  You'll see the results in your business and personal brand immediately--and better than you ever imagined.\n\nI love what Nick has done for me, and I'd hire him again in a second for anything to do with branding and content design. \n\nAnd the bonus? He's an amazing person inside and out who's become a friend. \n\nThank you so much Nick!",

    "about": "Manual finance processes don\u2019t just slow teams down, they quietly drain time, decision making quality, and profitability. Most companies only realize it when growth starts exposing the cracks.\n\nI help decision makers uncover the process inefficiencies they\u2019ve normalized and replace them with streamlined workflows and automation built to scale with the business, not complicate it.\n\nOver 25+ years working across India, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe, I\u2019ve seen firsthand why automation succeeds or fails. It\u2019s rarely about the tools. It\u2019s about understanding where processes break, who owns the work, and how operational design either strengthens or strangles growth.\n\nMy focus isn\u2019t building complexity. It\u2019s eliminating it and turning fragile, manual finance workflows into durable, scalable processes that companies can rely on.\n\nIf you're looking to scale smarter (not harder) and want processes built for real growth, I\u2019m always open to a conversation.",

Manisha has a unique ability to partner cross-functionally, understanding both the finance and business side. In my latest collaboration with her she played a key role in supporting a complex labor restructuring, where her leadership kept finance, business, and people teams aligned and focused on delivering results. Her communication is refreshingly direct, cutting through ambiguity and ensuring clarity at all times. On top of that, she\u2019s simply a great person to work with and fun to have on the team.

She has helped us develop financial operations processes, implemented models for our team to simplify data processing, and always takes the time to sit with each of our team members to share valuable knowledge about systems and financial applications. She is incredibly proactive and hardworking, always willing to take on as much work as possible to help us become more efficient, and consistently delivers high quality products in a timely manner.

He was exactly the marketing partner I\u2019d been looking for: reliable, thoughtful, and true to his word. His process was smooth, focused, and well-run. Most importantly, he helped turn an idea into something meaningful and genuinely useful. The feedback since launching my educational email campaign has confirmed the value of what we built. If you want a marketing partner who brings structure, clarity, and execution \u2014 I highly recommend working with Aldis.",

        "description": "I've worked with Chris in a number of capacities since I first met him in 2004. He continues to impress me with his diverse knowledge base and has been an excellent resource from which to learn, yet at the same time is very humble and eager to learn himself. Chris takes criticism and direction well, and is a consummate professional. His writing is exceptional in its ability to thoroughly explain complex concepts in a way that can be easily understood.",

He is great at putting people at ease even while he prepares them for work that will take them out of their comfort zones, a quality that is fantastic not only in a coach but also in a leader. I can warmly recommend working with both AJ and his brilliant partners. ",

Through nearly a decade of research, AJ presents his clients with ideas and strategies that have been proven to achieve desired results regarding personal development.  I've personally used what I learned from AJ and his team to land a promotion at my company and enhance my communication strategies regarding sales.

He's been nothing short of amazing, especially when we hit a rough patch and lost some of our key sales folks.\n\nArmando was the guy who stepped up big time. He didn't just sit back; he got right into the thick of things, helping us rebuild our sales team from the ground up. It's not just about strategies for him; he's all about getting his hands dirty and making things happen.\n\nWhat I really admire about Armando is his knack for sales. He's got this way of turning complex stuff into plans we can actually work with and make our team better. Plus, he's always pushing us to aim higher, which has led us to smash some of our toughest goals.\n\nBut it's not just about the numbers. Armando's a real leader \u2013 he's there for the team, offering guidance and support, making everyone around him better.\n\nIn short, Armando's a total asset and game-changer. He's made a huge difference in our team, and it's been awesome working with him.",
