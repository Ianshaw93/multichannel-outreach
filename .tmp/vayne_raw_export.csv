That’s where I come in—with strategy, structure, and the FROST Framework. I’m the co-founder of yorCMO, the first decentralized leadership franchise for fractional CMOs. And now, I’m scaling FractionalPros.com, a platform that connects SMBs with vetted fractional leaders—and helps those leaders find visibility, leads, and community through niche-driven peer pods. I believe in decentralized teams, strategic clarity, and the idea that every expert deserves a business model that works for them, not just because of them. I’ve had a non-linear career and life. I’ve: - Started a lawn care service in high school and sold the business before college - Studied and worked in chemical engineering - Founded 4 companies: from mortgage financing to media to data haptics tech - Published and written a book on media habits - Taught Entrepreneurship to university students - Created a documentary film on the seasons of entrepreneurship - Launched a community for fractional pros I spent years attempting to reconcile my wildly diverse experiences, let alone trying to explain them to those around me.

And leadership models built on control and hierarchy are breaking down. I provide architecture that makes teams self-managing for Fractionals, Business Owners, Consultants and Coaches. Leaders and HR partners tell me the same thing: “We know collaboration matters—but we can’t measure it, sustain it, or scale it.” That’s where the TIGERS® 6 Principles System comes in. It equips leaders and HR partners to turn AI-driven flattening into a human advantage through measurable trust, collaboration, and engagement. For more than 30 years, I’ve helped organizations—from Fortune 500s to nonprofits—create high-trust, self-aligning cultures that thrive in complexity. The TIGERS System builds six measurable principles that drive collaboration: Trust | Interdependence | Genuineness | Empathy | Risk Resolution | Success. These aren’t soft skills. They’re behavioral metrics that leaders can observe, measure, and scale. That’s why we license this framework to coaches, consultants, and HR partners who want to deliver sustainable, people-centered transformation that makes work easier not harder.

false,false,urn:li:member:5490822,Annie,Sires,mirrorviewmarketing@gmail.com,,"My journey's been quite a ride: from an Army brat to Military Police, then a police officer, paramedic, Navy spouse, and a business owner for 30 years. All those experiences gave me a unique lens for navigating life's big challenges. And my military dad? He taught me that your word is everything, period. That's always been my North Star. Then came the moment that changed everything. After my husband, Jim, passed away, I found myself in a really vulnerable spot, something I never expected despite my business success. That feeling was a huge wake-up call. I just refused to let anyone else go through that, so I dug in and mastered how to build lasting stability and well-being. My friends say I'm stubborn about everything, and hey, they're not wrong! For over 20 years, I've had the incredible privilege of helping hundreds of families and thousands of folks become their most resilient selves. My passion is empowering the people who truly keep our country going—veterans, folks in rural America, farmers, truckers, and entrepreneurs. I love taking complicated stuff and making it simple, helping people really step into their power. My approach is pretty straightforward: think strategically, make smart choices, and use what you've got effectively. My biggest tip? Consistent, focused effort really does pay off big time in the long run. With six generations of military service in my family, helping those who've served is deeply personal for me. And living out here in rural America, I'm constantly working to help our communities find their footing and build a strong future, generation after generation. You know that saying, ""you are who you spend time with""? That totally changed how I connect with people. I love bringing clients, experts, and executives together because I really get what makes them tick—their challenges, their dreams, all of it. When I'm not busy helping people create brighter futures, you'll find me on my farm, training horses and dogs. Oh, and get this: at 60, I'm on zero meds and can deadlift almost 300 pounds! It just goes to show you that the same rules apply whether you're building a strong life or a strong body: ditch what doesn't serve you, stay consistent, and nail the basics. That... is the new art of living.",Owner,"💥 What I do - I help Female Marketing Directors beat the stress of inflation, the cost of essentials and build their savings for emergencies and their future with easy options that make sense for their own specific goals and dreams, while minimizing governement involvement. 💥Why? - My dad was military and we moved over and over again so I learned at an early age to understand how your financial picture can drive your entire outlook. I helped people with budgeting when I was young and learned that a simple change could make a huge impact. While I was a Navy Spouse, I started and grew several businesses... So I learned the importance of financial conversations in business and with others and making the right decisions for our family. I then helped others do the same. 💥Industry Expertise: Dave Ramsey Teaching and Leading for 5 years.

Established in 1965, the college first opened its doors to students in the fall of 1966. Since that time, the JC has become a leader in innovative educational programs, dual credit education for area high school students, industrial and professional workforce training, and a critical player in the economy of the region. Situated on 219 acres, the college has over 637,000 gross square feet of building space with an enrollment of about 3,000 students. Students can receive an Associates of Arts, and Associates of Science, and an Associates of Applied Science, with an emphasis in several fields, plus we offer occupational certificate programs that provide a course of study preparing students directly for employment or self-employment upon completion of the program. Long a leader in dual credit education, well before the term was widely recognized, NMJC and area high schools have evolved a best practice model of dual credit and on campus career technical training courses that regularly results in high school seniors walking for their high school diploma and two-year degree in the same week. As an early adopter of distance education technology, NMJC provides a wide range of educational opportunities to students throughout the region and nation. Roughly one-third of NMJC student credit hours are produced in an online-learning environment. In workforce training and professional development, The JC provided more workforce training in 2014 for area residents and businesses than any other community college in New Mexico, despite the fact that its rural area is significantly smaller than the large metropolitan areas of the state. NMJC is a national leader in energy education and training. Serving an area of the country known as the Permian Basin, The JC has developed one of the first comprehensive oil field training facilities in the nation. In addition, the recent expansion of the nuclear industry in the region has driven development of a robust online training program for nuclear technicians. With support from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Lockheed Martin, The JC has become the college-of-choice for technical training in the nuclear industry. Annually, students in the nursing program at NMJC are ranked in the top ten percent of all nursing students in the nation, based on their national testing scores. The NMJC Law Enforcement Academy has been ranked one of the premiere academies in the state. Its instructors are in demand to help police departments throughout New Mexico with updated training for their forces. The NMJC Foundation has awarded over $2.5 million in scholarships and work-study assistance to NMJC students. Another $560,000 has funded program support for students and faculty. The foundation manages over 75 different endowments, annual scholarships and program assistance funds totaling over $8 million. New Mexico Junior College is one of the few community colleges in New Mexico with athletic programs. Student-athletes typically maintain high GPAs while competing. All six of the athletic programs earned post-season berths in either regional or national competitions.

International frustration slows, their business growths, success shows. Ready to talk? 📩 GetStarted@TheCultureMastery.com German by birth, American by choice, and Bavarian at heart, I am a fan of building bridges - across cultures - and not enthusiastic about walls. My clients know that ""soft skills"" are, in fact, hard. They come to us because they want to develop their ACE-Q (=AQ+CQ+EQ). I am a coach to executive global leaders and a cross-cultural consultant. People book me as a keynote speaker for international events. I am an experienced program facilitator, certified to work with the GlobeSmart Profile, the Inclusive Behaviors Inventory, the AQai assessment, and the CodeBreaker.BANKcode personality profile. I am also an NLP Master trainer. With my team at The Culture Mastery I help leaders close cultural gaps. Does your organization always meet its global growth goals? Without a solid foundation of cultural competence companies leave money on the table of international business. For more than a decade our clients have experienced measurable improvements and outrank their competition when it comes to structuring, leading, and communicating across cultures. I am a strong believer that any conflict can be resolved with a better understanding of our cultures. And as a German, burdened with the inherited guilt of the most horrific crime against humanity, it is my duty and moral obligation to make our world a more peaceful, responsible place. Our cultural training and coaching programs can be designed specifically for business leaders and thought leaders, as well as peace makers and rule makers. At The Culture Mastery we help people to work better together across cultures. When companies work internationally, their employees need to be effective in collaborating with people from cultures which are foreign to them. They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences. Failing to communicate, manage, inspire, and lead across cultural differences is a huge risk for these companies, and the lack of cultural competence can be a bottom-line relevant issue.",Founder + Owner,"Work. Together. Across Cultures. The Culture Mastery is a boutique training, coaching, and mentoring firm for global leaders who want to succeed in working across cultures. Our mission is to lead individuals and organizations to a better understanding of their own culture and those cultures they interact with, so they can work at their peak and in peace with each other, through teaching, training and coaching. Our vision is for a more peaceful world and we accomplish this by helping people from different cultures understand each other better. We don’t deliver training & development widgets; we help you attain a higher level of cultural awareness and competence. By mastering cultural transitions, you will be at peak performance in the global community. At The Culture Mastery, all team members have crossed cultures at least once in their lives. We serve the global business community with four main services: • Cultural Training & Coaching: In an international context, smart business decisions depend on the ability to bridge cultural differences. Team members need to be able to understand these differences and how to work across cultures. • Global Leadership Development: As leaders grow into their international roles, the skills which got them into their position will not be the same skills which will propel their global career. Smart executives learn how to lead in a global context. • Expat Services: When international employees take on assignments abroad, the challenges of relocation can make or break the project. Our Destination Services ease the pain of the mundane. • Language Support: Your global business can easily get lost in translation.

They shape careers, cultures, and communities... and, perhaps most importantly, they set an example for the people watching us most closely — at work, and at home. I’ve worn many hats: CEO, operating executive, advisor, dealmaker, coach, and podcast host. I’ve led sales from $400 million to over $1 billion in an organic growth cycle, delivered 4x growth in six years, navigated more than a dozen acquisitions, and opened new markets. I’ve worked in public companies, private equity-backed businesses, and family-owned enterprises in the middle of steep growth curves. The scale changes, but the through-line is always the same: connect great people, align them around a shared purpose, and give them the space to do their best work. That belief fuels my work at LEAD3R and as host of The Future of Teamwork Podcast, where I’ve interviewed more than 150 leaders from every corner of the working world. Each conversation is a masterclass in leadership - part learning, part teaching, always a reminder that kindness and clarity are not mutually exclusive in high performance. These dialogues sharpen my own leadership style, helping me find new ways to guide teams that are both values-driven and results-focused. I’m endlessly fascinated by the changing shape of tomorrow’s workplace - how technology, community, and business can intersect to tackle big challenges like diversity and inclusion, skills transfer, innovation, and disruption.

There’s a reason CEO's call me an ""M&A Whisperer"". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the ""unexpected people challenges"" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, ""NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions"" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach.

(Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: ""I can't take a real vacation without chaos"" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: ""I need to scale but organic growth is too slow"" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: ""I want options but don't know where to start"" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: ""It's time. Get me the best outcome possible"" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison.

Most tech company founders fail on their way to Series A funding because of poor decision-making and lack of direction. They may not even realize some of the mistakes they are making. Seed Round Capital’s personalized guidance provides expert advising so startups can raise the money they need, enjoy their journeys, and see exponential growth. As an early-stage startup founder you're likely overwhelmed by concerns about running out of money, letting people down and losing your dream.

As a startup, it can be very difficult to find the training, funding and support you need to succeed as a business, making you wonder why you even started the business in the first place.

false,false,urn:li:member:43862,Alex,Nesbitt,,,"I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

As Founder of Haas Strategy Solutions, I bring more than 40 years of management consulting experience across nonprofits, professional services, manufacturing, healthcare, defense, and emerging technology. My work complements internal planning by offering independent perspective, structured strategy processes, and an ethics lens that ensures decisions are resilient as well as ambitious. My career began in ecology and systems modeling, then expanded into public policy and decades of advising leaders at the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research, international science programs, and economic development institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Across these roles, I learned that organizations succeed or falter not only on technical brilliance, but on how well they align strategy, ecosystems, and ethics. That philosophy drives Haas Strategy Solutions today. My services focus on three core offerings: • Strategy Red Team — an independent second opinion that surfaces blind spots, challenges assumptions, and tests resilience before major commitments are made. • Strategy Foundation — a diagnostic and design process that clarifies mission, business model, and performance systems, giving leaders a stronger base for growth. • Strategy Stress Test — scenario-based evaluation of resilience under disruption, whether from technology, regulation, competition, or economic shocks. I also advise organizations working at the frontier of emerging technology—including AI, quantum computing, biotech, defense, energy, and advanced manufacturing. I help translate technical roadmaps into organizational clarity: mapping ecosystems, planning for scarce talent, designing commercialization pathways, and embedding ethics and governance as strategic differentiators. For 20 years, I also served as an ethics officer, which taught me that foresight and trust are not optional. In fields from personalized medicine to AI, ignoring ethics until too late has slowed adoption and triggered regulation. By contrast, organizations that anticipate these issues build legitimacy faster and endure longer.",Founder and Managing Partner,"Haas Strategy Solutions empowers midmarket executives and boards to navigate strategic challenges and enhance performance.

I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy.

false,false,urn:li:member:17859649,Sandy,Lamb,,,"Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

false,false,urn:li:member:32122792,Danielle,Falvella,,,"Over the past 15 years, I’ve partnered with C-suite executives, leadership teams, and fast-growing companies who are: Frustrated by inconsistent performance: high performers doing well, but many others unclear on priorities—and the gap between intention and results widening Struggling with leadership transitions: new roles, new teams, or scaling leadership layers without losing clarity or accountability Experiencing “culture drift”: when stated values are no longer lived out, morale is slipping, or misalignment is undermining collaboration and innovation Bewildered by performance systems that don’t motivate: annual reviews that feel like paperwork, metrics that don’t tie to behavior, or feedback processes that don’t stick 💪What I Do: I’m one of a small group of certified professionals who use a proprietary framework to tackle these hurdles. 🔍 Leadership Development – I work with individuals and teams to sharpen self-awareness, decision-making, and influence. Whether it's coaching new leaders or retooling executive thinking for a changing business landscape, I help people lead with clarity and confidence. 🌐 Culture Alignment – I help define, refresh or re-center organizational culture so it becomes an asset rather than a liability. That means making values visible, integrating them into day-to-day behaviors, and ensuring culture supports strategy, not fights it. 📈 Performance Management – I design performance systems that align everyone—from the front line to the C-suite—with business goals. That could include goal-setting frameworks, feedback loops, accountability structures, or measurement of progress in real time. What Clients Gain: ✅Clarity & consistency in leadership: everyone pulling in the same direction, with purpose ✅A culture that supports innovation, engagement & ethical decision-making ✅Performance systems that inspire and hold people accountable—with measurable results ✅More humility + higher trust in leadership; less friction, fewer reworks, quicker decision cycles Why Work With Me: Because I believe real change happens when leadership, culture, and performance systems are fully aligned—and when they are, companies don’t just function better—they become more resilient, more adaptive, and more trusted by their people and stakeholders. 🔗 If you’re a leader or executive ready to close gaps in leadership, culture or performance—and want concrete results rather than vague promises—let’s have a conversation.

My career has taken me from founding a tech company at 19 to leading innovation labs, launching global brands, and creating content that inspires others to rediscover themselves through motorcycles, creativity, and community. Today, I split my time between business and storytelling — as a marketing strategist, content creator, and mental health advocate. I’m the founder and face behind Zen Motorcycle Maintenance, a community of over 160,000 riders and a reach of more than 10 million monthly views, where I explore the intersection of motorcycles, philosophy, and mental health. I’m an official ambassador for Royal Enfield Motorcycles (and their Himalayan 450) and Cardo Systems, and I’ve collaborated with industry leaders including Honda, QuadLock, Biltwell, and Hedon Helmets. My work extends beyond the screen — leading rides, speaking at events, and creating experiences that remind riders to maintain their minds as well as their machines. As the author of The MotoJournal and creator of the Spark Unplugged personal growth program, I help people reconnect with their creativity, purpose, and balance in a hyper-connected world. Before this chapter, I served as Chief Marketing Officer at Auper Motorcycles, leading global strategy for an electric motorcycle startup, and as Head of Corporate Innovation at The Accelerator Centre, where I built programs connecting corporations with startups to pilot and commercialize new technologies. I’ve also founded and led three major innovation labs — in Kitchener, Halifax, and Toronto — partnering with government, academia, and industry to push what’s possible. I’ve spent my career proving that creativity, technology, and humanity belong together.

Clients often say I bring clarity where there’s complexity. I create space for meaningful conversations — calmly, with focus and without pressure. With a systemic lens, I help teams reconnect to what matters, reshape the way they collaborate, and regain sustainable momentum. What sets me apart is the balance I bring: • A practical, analytical mind — grounded in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt level), and a PhD in chemistry • A calm, human presence — able to surface hidden tensions, build trust, and mobilise teams around shared purpose • A strategic posture — focused on results that are both measurable and lasting • A practitioner-researcher mindset — where curiosity fuels continuous learning and deepens the value of my work for clients I bring a strong foundation in operational realities — from the shop floor to senior leadership — combined with certifications in Lean Six-Sigma, Human Centered Design, Executive and Team Coaching, as well as diagnostic tools in Team 360, change leadership and resiliency.

We call it Business as Ministry. Why is this important? Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact.

When you join the movement to improve child well-being, you open pathways to opportunity, helping to: - Give more families access to quality early learning programs, so kids become strong learners. - Provide apprenticeship opportunities for youth, equipping them for high-growth careers. - Put college within reach for more families, through academic supports and financial aid access. - Set individuals up for financial stability, through stable housing, access to healthcare and employment opportunities. - Support community-led solutions, so that everyone—regardless of race or zip code—can thrive.

Nearly 19 million people in the US live in “food deserts”, meaning they don’t live near a grocery store. It’s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I’m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can “see” how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don’t excite them or detract from what they love working on.

It all started with a paradox. Years ago, I went through a difficult period asking myself precisely the questions above. Searching for answers, I discovered that others shared my concerns. As I described it in my first book, I faced a paradox: ""Humanity does not suffer from a lack of answers; rather, it suffers despite the answers being available."" This paradox became the central quest that led to the start of a new school of psychology: meaningful purpose. Fortunately, I discovered the answers to these existential questions, solved the paradox, and built a practice to help people get the necessary remedies. The point? You, too, can deal with your own paradoxes and benefit by finding the answers to these existential questions. So, if you have big plans and have been giving your all … YET you are struggling with any of the following … • Resistance to your efforts to make a positive difference at work and in social settings. • Lack of Support preventing you from achieving your professional goals and life dreams. • Discouragement from trying to bring to life relationships that should thrive but don't. • Frustration that your contributions are not being acknowledged and appreciated. • Disappointment with people who are indifferent and unresponsive to your contributions, aspirations, and talent. • Exhaustion from investing in long hours at work for little to no appreciation. • Disappointed that your life lacks meaning and direction. But there is hope! The Boston Institute for Meaningful Purpose has something to end the pain. It is called ""Meaning Analysis and Improvement."" When you harness the ""Meaning Analysis and Improvement"" method, you will … • Deepen your self-understanding and of your surroundings. • Build your self-confidence. • Discover your strengths and confront your weaknesses courageously for self-improvement. • Discern what other's agendas and their motives are. • Know the ""real"" root cause of a problem or situation. • Understand what your options are and how to select the most promising one.

I design and deliver culturally responsive, community-rooted programs that disrupt incarceration cycles and create pathways to leadership, entrepreneurship, and opportunity.

That perspective, combined with years of consulting with youth systems, nonprofits, and community groups, allows me to bridge the gap between community and institutions. I am a product of community. From early years shaped by gangs and incarceration to becoming a leader in justice reform and entrepreneurship, I know the power of mentorship and second chances.

false,false,urn:li:member:2426167,Keith,Liscio,,,"I’m Keith Liscio, the Founder and President of Excelsior Franchise Center. My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners.

If your pipeline is stalling, your sales cycles are dragging, or your “growth plan” still relies on the founder’s Rolodex, the problem isn’t your team. It’s your system. Or lack of one. Most early-stage tech companies hit a plateau because they confuse motion with momentum. - They generate leads... but not sales conversations. - They hire reps... before fixing the funnel. - They enter the US market... with messaging that doesn’t land. Here’s what most teams miss: “You cannot succeed in your market without an intimate understanding of your ICP and why they’ll write you a check.” To catch the right fish, you need to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right bait. I teach you how. I’ve worked with over 50+ B2B SaaS and tech-enabled service companies, especially those in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated markets — to help them: - Multiply pipeline by 2–3× - Cut sales cycles in half - Reduce CAC by 30–50% - Build outbound systems that actually generate sales conversations - Create repeatable sales processes that don’t rely on heroics And I do it in a phased, capital-efficient way: Step 1 — ICP Sprint: Define and validate your highest-fit buyer segments, key decision makers, and messaging that resonates. Step 2 — Outreach Engine Build: Stand up a multichannel system (LinkedIn + email + content) that generates real conversations in less than 90 days.

But when companies get it right—when they develop strong leaders, put people in roles that fit their strengths, and create a culture where teams perform. That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees. I do this through leadership coaching, advisory, and fractional executive support, powered by data-driven tools like leadership diagnostics, psychometric assessments, and culture analytics.

Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business.

I’ve spent nearly 20-years in Corporate America doing everything from training, executive leadership, managing big box retail stores, owning my own consulting firm and even working in the coffee industry. In 2012, I decided to take a big risk and follow my heart; leaving Corporate America to launch Booya! Okay, this is where the peacock comes in. The Booya! bird was our mascot. You see peacocks remind us to laugh at life. They remind us that joy can be found inside our soul even during the most trying of times. Booya! was a joy movement. I started Booya! because I saw a desperate need for bringing energy, hope and light back to this world. This of course did not happen solo. There was an amazing team of people who shared the same passion for a better world. In fact, there were 100,000 people who shared our same passion. We had classes and events throughout the city all in the name of joy. We even brought together 1,000 hula hoopers to beat The World Book of Records. As you can imagine, the media caught on and the Booya! buzz was everywhere. People loved it! One thing led to another and I created a methodology that brought together the joy concept of Booya! and Corporate America. I pitched it, and I was DENIED. Over and over again. I was told, “Gina, your ideas are way too progressive. Too far out there. It’ll never work.” So I decided to write a book proving that a whole new world of business that’s good for people, profit and the Earth is possible. And Fuel Your Business was born. http://www.amazon.com/Fuel-Your-Business-Energize-Profits/dp/1601632967 This was only the beginning. In addition to business, my life work is spiritual wellness.

I help Visionaries like you build real businesses, not high-paying jobs. As a Fractional Integrator and COO, I step in as your Second-in-Command.

Install discipline – Use tools like scorecards, Rocks, and Meeting Rhythms that actually get traction. 3. Free you to lead – Remove you from day-to-day ops so you can stay in your zone of genius.

false,true,urn:li:member:293034752,Mason,Scurry,,,"By the age of 22, I'd: - Founded 4 businesses and sold 1 - Founded 2 non-profits and been program director at a 3rd - Directly mentored 300+ young entrepreneurs - Been appointed to faculty of an Ivy League University - Published 2 books Naturally, when I graduated from Brown, I had no interest in getting a job. But I had to make a living, so I founded a marketing agency. I worked with B2B service businesses, and promised them what everyone does. More marketing means: - More leads - More clients - More revenue Long story short, that didn't happen. I wasn't getting results because my approach was wrong. I noticed: Like most businesses, when B2B service firms want more clients, they invest in marketing. They chase cold leads, lose a ton of money, and wonder why nothing's working. So rather than being yet another run-of-the-mill marketing agency, I pivoted. Now, I build infrastructure to get more referrals. Why? It's the cheapest, fastest, and most effective way for a B2B service firm to grow. WHAT I BUILD: Referable Brand → Positioning and messaging so clients know exactly who to refer to you Validation-Ready Digital Presence → Website and LinkedIn optimized for referral confidence, not SEO traffic Relationship CRM → Automated touchpoints that keep your network warm and generate systematic referrals WHO THIS IS FOR: Established B2B service firms ($500K-$5M) with 20+ client relationships but no system to leverage them. Consulting firms, agencies, coaches. WHY REFERRALS ARE BETTER: - They convert 71% higher than paid leads - They close 69% faster - Retention rates are 37% higher You might worry about being dependent on referrals. Odds are, you're not dependent ENOUGH. I've built infrastructure for 20+ clients in the past year—creative agencies, solo consultants, coaches, EOS implementers, even a catering company. Ready to do what ACTUALLY works? Book a free 60-minute strategy session. I'll tell you how to sign 5 new clients without spending a dime. (It's not magic, it's referrals)",Founder and Principal,"I help B2B founders build client acquisition systems rooted in relationships, not lead generation. Services: - CRM design & implementation (built for trust, not tracking) - LinkedIn & outreach strategy (conversations, not cold pitching) - Marketing automation (that feels human) - Fractional CMO services Approach: Unlike traditional consultants who hand you templates, I design custom systems based on the psychology of relationships. This leads to 3x more referrals, 37% higher retention, and businesses founders actually love running. Who I work with: B2B founders, consultants, agencies, and service providers tired of pushy sales tactics.",12/2024,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-scurry,"Athens, Georgia, United States",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:105852343,Scurry Consulting,https://www.linkedin.com/company/customer-acquisition-consulting-llc/,www.masonscurryconsulting.com,"At Scurry Consulting, we help entrepreneurs build better businesses by designing simple, effective systems that support sustainable growth. We work with founders who have vision, traction, and drive—but lack the structure to scale with confidence. We specialize in three things: 1. Sales Funnels that Convert 2. CRMs that Work for You 3. Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you.

That belief has shaped my two-decade journey as a leadership consultant, certified coach, and intercultural expert. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of partnering with organizations to foster inclusive, collaborative, and high-performing cultures that drive engagement, innovation, and sustainable success. My career is rooted in a simple yet powerful philosophy: resolving differences leads to redefining leadership. From navigating complex organizational challenges to coaching executives, my work is guided by a structured process I call the Reconciliation Method™. This approach bridges diverse perspectives into cohesive strategies, delivering solutions that are not only actionable but authentically aligned with an organization’s values. Whether I’m facilitating cultural audits, optimizing team dynamics, or coaching leaders to connect their values with their actions, I aim to help organizations thrive by putting people at the heart of their success. Over the years, I’ve led the design and global expansion of DEIB strategies, cultivated growth-oriented, human-centered cultures, and created frameworks for alignment that endure. My process is both data-driven and deeply empathetic, ensuring every recommendation is practical, sustainable, and meaningful. I specialize in leadership development, organizational alignment, and creating cultural transformation that sticks. When I’m not immersed in bridging gaps and aligning leadership values, you’ll often find me exploring new cities, indulging in the rich history and local cuisine that each place has to offer. As a firm believer in the power of connection, I also cherish moments spent with friends and family—whether at a lively dinner table or a serene outdoor retreat. My mission is clear: to help leaders and teams unlock their full potential, fostering cultures where collaboration isn’t just a goal—it’s the standard.

Together, we explore new perspectives and identify solutions for growth and success as well as health and well-being. In 1998, I moved from my native Finland to New York City.

I held career services and HR & development roles before founding my independent coaching practice. My expertise lies in international and highly-demanding professional contexts—since founding my practice, my work has taken me to Helsinki, Rome, Bangkok, and Bonn and I’ve worked with leaders based across six continents. Sisu—the Finnish concept of resilience—and my own personal experiences as an immigrant have deeply influenced my coaching philosophy. My approach to coaching is built upon a core belief in our human capacity to learn and grow, to succeed through challenges, and live and lead with purpose. Alongside my coaching practice, I am an experienced senior non-profit founder and board leader. I have founded, led, and developed several global and local non-profit community organizations over the past 30 years.

Later, I realized that I could have an additional impact by being a part of getting new business energy into those spaces for revitalization and growth.

I’m a retired police officer, keynote speaker, award-winning author, and family conflict resolution specialist—but more than that, I’m a bridge-builder. Between systems and people. Between leaders and their teams. Between families and the youth they love. After 21 years in law enforcement—including 8.5 years as a School Resource Officer—I’ve seen what happens when people lose connection. I’ve watched families fracture, leaders burn out, teams implode, and kids fall through the cracks. Not because people didn’t care—but because they didn’t know how to lead through the hard stuff. That’s why I created the CALM Leadership Method™—a trust-centered, emotionally intelligent approach to leadership that works in real life. Under pressure. In crisis. In the moments that matter most. I now help corporate teams, educators, frontline professionals, and families lead with connection, rebuild trust where it’s been lost, and communicate clearly when it counts most—at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Whether I’m on stage speaking to executives, equipping frontline teams, or sitting across from a family in conflict, I bring the same message: Connection heals what correction can’t. And if we don’t fix the disconnection, we lose the people who need us most. I’m also the author of the award-winning book Youth Truth: Engaging in Conversations That Can Change Lives—a raw, practical guide that equips parents, educators, and mentors to connect with today’s youth on the tough topics that matter most. It’s not just a book—it’s a bridge between generations, emotions, and relationships. Through real stories, bold truths, and actionable tools, I teach people how to lead with clarity, courage, and compassion—without burning out or checking out. Because when we get connection right, everything changes.
