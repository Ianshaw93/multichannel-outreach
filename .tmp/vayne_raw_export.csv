It was rediscovered by Gotama Buddha more than 2500 years ago and was taught by him as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an Art Of Living. This non-sectarian technique aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation. Vipassana is a way of self-transformation through self-observation. It focuses on the deep interconnection between mind and body, which can be experienced directly by disciplined attention to the physical sensations that form the life of the body, and that continuously interconnect and condition the life of the mind. It is this observation-based, self-exploratory journey to the common root of mind and body that dissolves mental impurity, resulting in a balanced mind full of love and compassion. The scientific laws that operate one's thoughts, feelings, judgements and sensations become clear. Through direct experience, the nature of how one grows or regresses, how one produces suffering or frees oneself from suffering is understood. Life becomes characterized by increased awareness, non-delusion, self-control and peace. Since the time of Buddha, Vipassana has been handed down, to the present day, by an unbroken chain of teachers. The current teachers in this tradition were appointed by the late Mr. S.N. Goenka, who was Indian by descent but was born and raised in Burma (Myanmar). While living there, he had the good fortune to learn Vipassana from his teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin, who was at the time a high Government official. After receiving training from his teacher for fourteen years, Mr. Goenka settled in India and was authorised by Sayagyi to begin teaching Vipassana in 1969.",,51-200,Education,,,09/2025,3,2.5M USD - 5M USD,🦊🤖🤓 #DeepTech #Hardware #Investor,true,true,"Digital Marketing, Online Advertising, Web Analytics, E-commerce, Strategy, Advertising, Online Marketing, Start-ups, Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Digital Strategy, PPC, Entrepreneurship, Marketing Strategy, Digital Media, Mobile Marketing, SEM, Email Marketing, Search Advertising, Integrated Marketing, Project Management, Content Strategy, Media Planning, Affiliate Marketing, CRM, Sales Management, Customer Acquisition, Conversion Optimization, Content Marketing, Customer Retention, Data Visualization, Mobile Advertising, Display Advertising, Google Adwords, Google Analytics, Management, Strategic Partnerships, Team Management, Team Leadership, Team Building, Growth Strategies, Start-up Consulting, Profitable Growth, Start-up Ventures, Referral Marketing, Online Lead Generation, Landing Page Optimization, Early-stage Startups, Data Science, A/B testing","Spanish, Italian, English, French, Mandarin, Japanese, Portuguese, German",Executive MBA,Finance,10/2022,03/2024,WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business),https://www.linkedin.com/school/wu-wirtschaftsuniversitaet-wien/,"WU is a leading academic institution and one of Europe’s most attractive universities in business and economics.

For any service provider, there is no question on whether or not you will run out of bandwidth and plateau. If you are not one of the very few who can set new goals and change your limiting relationships, habits and support structure, breaking out of this will be difficult. This requires coaching. Business Owners are limited on growth by the talent, capabilities and behaviors of their salespeople. Too many business owners hire salespeople based on their resume, recognizable personality traits and how well they interview. They fire them based on suitability. The recruiting process does not allow them to get into the things that are more important like are they motivated enough, can they exhibit the right behaviors in your selling environment and do they have the right soft skills to be successful. They are not on-boarded properly, working well defined markets, have a detailed prospecting plan and tracking the right things to know they will be successful and how to improve. As a result, they spend too much time prospecting and not enough time in meetings closing business. Any sales team will have 20% doing well, 10% struggling and the other 70% mediocre. No one hires salespeople expecting mediocrity. We take the people with potential from average to top producer with training and coaching.

What if I told you that a tiny shift in thinking could have a massive impact on your future - - would you want to grow more? A single profound insight could help you radically grow your business, launch a career or improve a relationship. Most businesses stagnate after just a few years of growth. Why is that? The main problem is that instead of relentlessly focusing on what is important most leaders focus on everything else. This is called the ""tyranny of the urgent."" We see this almost every day. When this happens the machinery of the organization begins to get clogged up and often times outdated. This is when creativity lags and the cutting edge becomes dull. Our goal is to help leaders and their teams fine-tune and supercharge their organizational performance. Just like... - David who was exhausted and ready to sell his business. Now enjoying the greatest profits and time freedom he's ever had. - Corey who runs a car wash chain and doubled in size from 6 to 13 sites while also building his leadership team - Dr. Saeed who was losing multiple 6 figures a year on process inefficiencies in his spine clinic. Now reaping much higher profits by taking care of his clients and referral partners better - Heather rapidly grew her family law firm, was able to move into a much nicer office building and spend more time with her family. - Jordan was able to greatly reduce their turnover, empower their departmental leads which has led to 3 straight years of 7 figure growth.
