That’s where I come in—with strategy, structure, and the FROST Framework. I’m the co-founder of yorCMO, the first decentralized leadership franchise for fractional CMOs. And now, I’m scaling FractionalPros.com, a platform that connects SMBs with vetted fractional leaders—and helps those leaders find visibility, leads, and community through niche-driven peer pods. I believe in decentralized teams, strategic clarity, and the idea that every expert deserves a business model that works for them, not just because of them. I’ve had a non-linear career and life. I’ve: - Started a lawn care service in high school and sold the business before college - Studied and worked in chemical engineering - Founded 4 companies: from mortgage financing to media to data haptics tech - Published and written a book on media habits - Taught Entrepreneurship to university students - Created a documentary film on the seasons of entrepreneurship - Launched a community for fractional pros I spent years attempting to reconcile my wildly diverse experiences, let alone trying to explain them to those around me. Eventually, I realized that my decentralized nature was an asset: I could help other entrepreneurs engineer non-traditional, weird, unexpected and creative ideas into their businesses.

All those experiences gave me a unique lens for navigating life's big challenges. And my military dad? He taught me that your word is everything, period. That's always been my North Star. Then came the moment that changed everything. After my husband, Jim, passed away, I found myself in a really vulnerable spot, something I never expected despite my business success. That feeling was a huge wake-up call. I just refused to let anyone else go through that, so I dug in and mastered how to build lasting stability and well-being. My friends say I'm stubborn about everything, and hey, they're not wrong! For over 20 years, I've had the incredible privilege of helping hundreds of families and thousands of folks become their most resilient selves. My passion is empowering the people who truly keep our country going—veterans, folks in rural America, farmers, truckers, and entrepreneurs. I love taking complicated stuff and making it simple, helping people really step into their power. My approach is pretty straightforward: think strategically, make smart choices, and use what you've got effectively. My biggest tip? Consistent, focused effort really does pay off big time in the long run. With six generations of military service in my family, helping those who've served is deeply personal for me. And living out here in rural America, I'm constantly working to help our communities find their footing and build a strong future, generation after generation. You know that saying, ""you are who you spend time with""? That totally changed how I connect with people. I love bringing clients, experts, and executives together because I really get what makes them tick—their challenges, their dreams, all of it. When I'm not busy helping people create brighter futures, you'll find me on my farm, training horses and dogs. Oh, and get this: at 60, I'm on zero meds and can deadlift almost 300 pounds! It just goes to show you that the same rules apply whether you're building a strong life or a strong body: ditch what doesn't serve you, stay consistent, and nail the basics. That... is the new art of living.",Owner,"💥 What I do - I help Female Marketing Directors beat the stress of inflation, the cost of essentials and build their savings for emergencies and their future with easy options that make sense for their own specific goals and dreams, while minimizing governement involvement. 💥Why? - My dad was military and we moved over and over again so I learned at an early age to understand how your financial picture can drive your entire outlook. I helped people with budgeting when I was young and learned that a simple change could make a huge impact. While I was a Navy Spouse, I started and grew several businesses... So I learned the importance of financial conversations in business and with others and making the right decisions for our family. I then helped others do the same. 💥Industry Expertise: Dave Ramsey Teaching and Leading for 5 years.

We design and implement connected GTM infrastructure across outbound, inbound, RevOps, content, and AI execution. Instead of running isolated campaigns, we focus on building repeatable systems that create consistent pipeline and momentum over time. Our work is centered around six core systems, deployed based on where growth breaks down. These include AI powered outbound engines, account based intent systems, inbound flow orchestration, CRM activation, content engagement systems, and AI agent orchestration for faster and more consistent execution. Each system is designed to work together as one revenue motion, ensuring that signals are captured, data is usable, and opportunities move forward instead of getting lost. Kinetyca was founded on the belief that revenue becomes predictable when go to market efforts are structured as systems rather than tactics. We combine strategy, tooling, and hands on implementation to help teams move from fragmented execution to clarity and control. We work with B2B startups, scale ups, and revenue teams who want to own their GTM motion, not rely on constant experimentation or manual effort.

Whether it was identifying problems when no one else was looking, asking the probing questions that every parent dreads, or offering solutions—sometimes unsolicited—I was always driven to make things better. If you had asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answers would have included lawyer, police officer, or doctor. As I got older, I knew those weren't right for me. My career journey has taken me through various sectors, including small to medium-sized businesses, the service industry, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C., a mega-church, and local government. In each organization, I consistently sought to understand the challenges at hand. I asked questions, identified issues, and proposed solutions—some welcomed, others less so. Regardless of the setting, my focus remained on finding the most strategic and logical paths forward. This involved refining existing processes and systems. One recurring theme across all these organizations was a lack of clarity in management and leadership. Employees often struggled with unclear expectations, resulting in low morale and plenty of “water cooler” conversations post-meetings. Furthermore, genuine people development was frequently overlooked. Through my diverse work experiences and education, I discovered the sweet spot where my skills and passions intersected. Today, I have the privilege of helping businesses transform their operations and cultures. I collaborate closely with business owners to diagnose their challenges and craft tailored growth strategies. The best part? They define what success looks like for them, and together we build a roadmap to achieve it. Are You Facing These Challenges? ⏩ Is your business growing but you're unsure how to sustain that momentum? ⏩ Is your team not performing at the level you know they can? ⏩ Are you bogged down by a lack of clarity and ineffective processes that hinder your growth? ⏩ Are you tired of feeling overwhelmed as a business owner or CEO and longing for more balance in your life? If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, I want to invite you into a conversation.

Women served on some committees but, were not allowed to hold office and did not have voting privileges. Because women were paid lower salaries in those days, most women could not afford to join the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1950, that all changed. Martha McKinley received permission from the President of the Chamber to form a “Women’s Section”, with dues more affordable to the working women of that time. They were to have their own Officers and Bylaws. For the next 40 years, the Women’s Section acted as a support group for the Chamber. In 1990 it was time for a change and thus evolved the Fresno County Women’s Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) organization.

Established in 1965, the college first opened its doors to students in the fall of 1966. Since that time, the JC has become a leader in innovative educational programs, dual credit education for area high school students, industrial and professional workforce training, and a critical player in the economy of the region. Situated on 219 acres, the college has over 637,000 gross square feet of building space with an enrollment of about 3,000 students. Students can receive an Associates of Arts, and Associates of Science, and an Associates of Applied Science, with an emphasis in several fields, plus we offer occupational certificate programs that provide a course of study preparing students directly for employment or self-employment upon completion of the program. Long a leader in dual credit education, well before the term was widely recognized, NMJC and area high schools have evolved a best practice model of dual credit and on campus career technical training courses that regularly results in high school seniors walking for their high school diploma and two-year degree in the same week. As an early adopter of distance education technology, NMJC provides a wide range of educational opportunities to students throughout the region and nation. Roughly one-third of NMJC student credit hours are produced in an online-learning environment. In workforce training and professional development, The JC provided more workforce training in 2014 for area residents and businesses than any other community college in New Mexico, despite the fact that its rural area is significantly smaller than the large metropolitan areas of the state. NMJC is a national leader in energy education and training. Serving an area of the country known as the Permian Basin, The JC has developed one of the first comprehensive oil field training facilities in the nation. In addition, the recent expansion of the nuclear industry in the region has driven development of a robust online training program for nuclear technicians. With support from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Lockheed Martin, The JC has become the college-of-choice for technical training in the nuclear industry. Annually, students in the nursing program at NMJC are ranked in the top ten percent of all nursing students in the nation, based on their national testing scores. The NMJC Law Enforcement Academy has been ranked one of the premiere academies in the state. Its instructors are in demand to help police departments throughout New Mexico with updated training for their forces.

I was surrounded by leaders in the wrong positions and people in positions of authority who had no business being there. I want to give people who are considering leadership, those in leadership who are struggling, and executives who are over their heads an opportunity to develop before they hurt someone or themselves. I want to see the day when workers do not have to go home and consume their dinner and talk about the underdeveloped and unprepared leaders they work for. Do you know the leader I am talking about or is that you? Ok, so here is all the other stuff people want to see: I am a Best-selling author of A Lion's Pride: The Scars That Silenced Kings, and I co-authored Voices for Leadership: Your Pathway to Becoming a More Influential Leader, The Latino Leadership Playbook, and Latinos 100. I have served as an Executive, Business Owner, Veteran & Advocate, Board Member, Non-Profit Administrator, Speaker, Mentor, Coach, and Avid Volunteer. Over the past 30 years, I have held numerous executive advisor and senior positions while serving in the United States Navy and civilian sector. Through education and training, I helped strengthen the chain of command and businesses, providing sound decision support and creating open communication at all levels. I also helped formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, and training of Navy and civilian personnel. My performance won me the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. I was named 2013, 2014, and 2017 Mentor of the Year, and recipient of the inaugural 2014 Chief John Dungan Jr. Oceanographer of the Navy Award. I was also awarded The Arnold Fletcher Award and inducted into the SALUTE National honors society for my academic achievements. I volunteer actively for various projects and non-profits, earning the esteemed Bronze, Silver, and Gold President’s Volunteer Service Award. I host the Award-Winning Developing the Leader Within Podcast. On the DTLW Podcast, I share real-world leadership lessons shaped by my personal experiences, challenges, and victories.

And when it does, it won’t care about your org chart or your P&L. It will simply do what it does: shape behavior, accelerate alignment, or erode value. If you are leading a global team, we should talk: 📩 office@theculturemastery.com Culture is already costing you. You just can’t see it yet.

false,false,urn:li:member:21625100,Dane,Groeneveld,,8322050160,"Over the years, I’ve learned that the decisions we make as leaders ripple far beyond the boardroom. They shape careers, cultures, and communities... and, perhaps most importantly, they set an example for the people watching us most closely — at work, and at home. I’ve worn many hats: CEO, operating executive, advisor, dealmaker, coach, and podcast host. I’ve led sales from $400 million to over $1 billion in an organic growth cycle, delivered 4x growth in six years, navigated more than a dozen acquisitions, and opened new markets. I’ve worked in public companies, private equity-backed businesses, and family-owned enterprises in the middle of steep growth curves. The scale changes, but the through-line is always the same: connect great people, align them around a shared purpose, and give them the space to do their best work. That belief fuels my work at LEAD3R and as host of The Future of Teamwork Podcast, where I’ve interviewed more than 150 leaders from every corner of the working world. Each conversation is a masterclass in leadership - part learning, part teaching, always a reminder that kindness and clarity are not mutually exclusive in high performance. These dialogues sharpen my own leadership style, helping me find new ways to guide teams that are both values-driven and results-focused. I’m endlessly fascinated by the changing shape of tomorrow’s workplace - how technology, community, and business can intersect to tackle big challenges like diversity and inclusion, skills transfer, innovation, and disruption. It’s a space where curiosity is an asset, and collaboration is both art and science. At this point in my career, I know two things for certain: great teams don’t happen by accident, and leadership is a privilege that comes with a responsibility to use it well.

There’s a reason CEO's call me an ""M&A Whisperer"". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the ""unexpected people challenges"" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, ""NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions"" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc.

true,true,urn:li:member:1270637,Daniel,Sweet,dsweet@sweetviewpartners.com,,"I'm not an exit consultant. I help owners build businesses they never want to sell. (Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: ""I can't take a real vacation without chaos"" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: ""I need to scale but organic growth is too slow"" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: ""I want options but don't know where to start"" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: ""It's time. Get me the best outcome possible"" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison. Multiple options = freedom. 📊 Find out where you stand: Send me a message and let's talk about where you are and where you want to be. 📚 Or start with my book: ""Unlocking Small Business Value"" The playbook I wish I'd had for my first acquisition: https://grw.bz/unlock P.S.

true,false,urn:li:member:43862,Alex,Nesbitt,,,"I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

false,true,urn:li:member:21421769,Lisa,Friscia,,,"Most organizations are built to break under pressure. As complexity grows, roles blur. Trust thins. Decisions stall. Culture becomes a slogan instead of a system. Performance starts to feel like politics. Morale tanks. That’s not a motivation problem. It’s a systems failure. And you can’t fix systems with hype, pulse surveys, or another off-site. You need infrastructure—the kind that scales clarity, trust, and execution without burning your team out. That’s where I come in. I’m a strategic advisor and fractional Chief People Officer. I partner with CEOs and executive teams to build the people infrastructure that makes leadership sustainable—and performance inevitable. What that looks like: ▪️ Executive onboarding that builds trust & traction—not just orientation ▪️ Leadership team development that shifts behavior—not alignment theater ▪️ Culture operating systems that turn values into decisions—not wall art ▪️ Performance architecture that actually gets used—not another abandoned framework I’m typically brought in when: ▪️ Culture and leadership aren’t keeping pace with complexity—showing up in turnover, missed goals, or decision paralysis ▪️ Feedback and performance systems feel fragile or performative ▪️ Legacy habits are blocking next-level execution ▪️ A new exec hire or strategic shift needs to land fast and lead hard My edge? I learned to build systems where failure wasn’t an option. I spent over a decade as a teacher, principal, and system-level education leader—environments where broken systems have immediate consequences. That’s where I learned to design for equity, lead through complexity, and build trust in high-stakes conditions. Now I bring that same pressure-tested lens to companies that can’t afford to get people systems wrong. Recent impact: → Helped a global nonprofit build shared language and capacity → Rebuilt performance management from form-filling to real growth conversations → Guided managing directors through M&A transition at a newly PE-backed firm → Built strategic roadmap that expanded leadership team impact for a school head Here’s what I know: You don’t fix culture with charisma. You don’t fix performance with perks. You fix them with infrastructure—clear roles, fair processes, and systems that scale trust. When people systems are designed with intention, change doesn’t just happen. It sticks. And it spreads. 👉 https://calendly.com/lfriscia/20-minute-discovery-call Want more thinking like this?

But as organizations grow or shift, the very things that made them successful can start to strain: decisions slow, roles blur, feedback becomes inconsistent, and execution relies on a few people carrying too much. Franca Consulting helps organizations move from scrappy to sustainable by building leadership and talent infrastructure that increases clarity, capacity, and execution — without burning people out. We partner with CEOs, executive teams, and senior leaders in social enterprise, nonprofits, schools, and purpose-led organizations to strengthen the systems that make leadership work: how decisions get made, how roles are defined, how feedback and learning happen, and how change actually lands. Our work is grounded in a simple belief: most leadership challenges aren’t about effort or commitment — they’re about infrastructure. How We Work We focus on practical, system-level support that leaders can use immediately, including: -Leadership Infrastructure Diagnostics to surface what’s creating drag and where to focus first -Design & Strategy Sprints to translate priorities into executable plans -Facilitation & Leadership Alignment to build shared language, habits, and decision clarity This is not cookie-cutter solutions or one-off training. It’s infrastructure-building work designed to support both performance and people.

Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher™. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME™) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME™ trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach™ program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)– because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME™ company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment – again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours.

When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher™ tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME™ helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME™ gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years.

Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs.

Building the non-technical skills for technical experts. • Strategic Advisory: Providing thought partnership for leaders, particularly those with technical-based career paths. • Program Design & Facilitation: Crafting and leading retreats, leadership development cohorts, and workshop series tailored to client needs. • Academic teaching and advising: Adjunct Professor and Faculty for curriculum grounded in career readiness.

CORPORATE CLIENTS Growing firms don’t (usually!) fail because they lack effort. They stall because clarity and capability don’t keep pace with growth. Resolute helps firms see what actually needs attention, align people and priorities, and develop leaders in ways that change how work gets done. We bring a clear-eyed, both/and perspective - human and business, strategy and execution - to deliver high-quality development that works at the level you need it, whether that’s one leader or the entire firm. The result is stronger leadership, better decisions, and growth that’s intentional instead of reactive. INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS Ambitious professionals don't need more advice - they need clarity, perspective, and a place to think honestly. Resolute works with capable leaders who are navigating bigger expectations, more complexity, and higher stakes, helping them separate the signal from the noise and move forward with both confidence and competence. As a trusted thinking partner, we bring structure, insight, and accountability - balancing challenge and support - to help leaders make better decisions, build real capability, and sustain momentum over time. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS Professional associations succeed when their leaders are prepared, aligned, and confident - and many volunteer leaders aren’t given the development they need to lead well. Resolute partners with associations to design and deliver professional development that respects volunteers’ time, intelligence, and real-world constraints while still creating meaningful growth. Our work is practical, human-centered, and rigorous, helping boards, committees, and cohort participants build the competencies and confidence needed to lead effectively and strengthen the organization as a whole.","professional development, training, leadership training, management training, executive coaching, leadership advisory, strategic support, career development, adjunct faculty, public speaking, speaking, presenting",myself only,Professional Services,2018,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",,4,500T USD - 1M USD,Career Development Advisor,Working with students in the Masters program in Global and International Studies at USAL.

true,false,urn:li:member:17859649,Sandy,Lamb,,,"Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

I’ve had a front-row seat to how organizations 𝒕𝒓𝒚 to get work done. I’ve spent years helping companies across banking, finance, healthcare, insurance, and retail adopt modern, agile ways of working, most often at the enterprise level. My work has spanned team-level change to large-scale transformations, helping organizations adopt frameworks like Scrum and Kanban and scale their practices using SAFe and variations of it. I became a 𝗖𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿® (𝗖𝗦𝗧) through Scrum Alliance, a designation held by a small number of people worldwide. I’m proud of this accomplishment because it reflects years of real-world experience applying Scrum where it truly fits. I offer public and private Scrum training for teams new to Scrum or that need a reset, because despite new frameworks and trends, Scrum is often still the 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 framework for the 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 teams, when taught well and applied intentionally. Enterprise work has been meaningful but also eye-opening. In big organizations, impact often happens in pockets. A few teams. A department. A pilot. Progress is real but slow, and it’s common to run into walls you can’t move, regardless of experience. That led me to a deliberate shift. I apply everything I’ve learned, what works, what doesn’t, and where organizations get stuck, and apply it to 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, including founders and solopreneurs. This is where decisions matter more, change happens faster, and the impact is immediate. My work now shows up in three primary ways: 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Helping teams build strong foundations and use Scrum thoughtfully, not mechanically. 𝗦𝗠𝗕 & 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Helping companies grow revenue, streamline operations, clarify strategy, and align goals to execution. Less chaos. More focus. Forward momentum. 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: Delivering keynotes and workshops on accountability, ownership, intrinsic motivation, and intentional innovation. Perspective matters. I’ve seen what happens when strategy is disconnected from execution and how powerful it can be when leaders get clear, stay focused, and give teams both structure and agency.

We call it Business as Ministry. Why is this important? Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact. At Crowell, business education is designed so you learn and put into practice career-relevant business skills while engaging your faith and launching your career.

true,false,urn:li:member:11885921,Dawn,Parks,,,"You know how hard it is to buy fresh food at reasonable prices year-round that hasn’t travelled thousands of miles and arrived at the grocery store still “green”? Nearly 19 million people in the US live in “food deserts”, meaning they don’t live near a grocery store. It’s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I’m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can “see” how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don’t excite them or detract from what they love working on.

It all started with a paradox. Years ago, I went through a difficult period asking myself precisely the questions above. Searching for answers, I discovered that others shared my concerns. As I described it in my first book, I faced a paradox: ""Humanity does not suffer from a lack of answers; rather, it suffers despite the answers being available."" This paradox became the central quest that led to the start of a new school of psychology: meaningful purpose. Fortunately, I discovered the answers to these existential questions, solved the paradox, and built a practice to help people get the necessary remedies. The point? You, too, can deal with your own paradoxes and benefit by finding the answers to these existential questions. So, if you have big plans and have been giving your all … YET you are struggling with any of the following … • Resistance to your efforts to make a positive difference at work and in social settings. • Lack of Support preventing you from achieving your professional goals and life dreams. • Discouragement from trying to bring to life relationships that should thrive but don't. • Frustration that your contributions are not being acknowledged and appreciated. • Disappointment with people who are indifferent and unresponsive to your contributions, aspirations, and talent. • Exhaustion from investing in long hours at work for little to no appreciation. • Disappointed that your life lacks meaning and direction. But there is hope! The Boston Institute for Meaningful Purpose has something to end the pain. It is called ""Meaning Analysis and Improvement."" When you harness the ""Meaning Analysis and Improvement"" method, you will … • Deepen your self-understanding and of your surroundings. • Build your self-confidence. • Discover your strengths and confront your weaknesses courageously for self-improvement. • Discern what other's agendas and their motives are. • Know the ""real"" root cause of a problem or situation. • Understand what your options are and how to select the most promising one.

My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners. If you’re serious about being in business, I can find one that will fit your needs.

After a 30+ year career in high-tech, comprised of both start-ups and enterprises, I founded the 20/20 Consulting Group to help leaders operate their organizations. Every organization runs on an invisible operating system => the flow of collaboration, influence, communication, knowledge, and trust that determines how fast work moves and how effectively strategy turns into results. By revealing this hidden system, leaders can see their Employee Relationship Capital: the collective value of employees, and their networks, who accelerate execution, broker trust across silos, and enable influence to flow through relationships that are invisible to org charts. Org design and work can be highly tuned and strategically adapted to fluid, ever-changing conditions. Scenario planning and critical employee decisions are supported by the following: => Which employees are the connectors and bridge builders? => Where does collaboration, communication and influence break down? => Which overly connected employees are at risk of burnout? => Who are the must retain employees? => Who are the sources of innovation and knowledge sharing? => Where do investments in people deliver the highest returns? By measuring how work and information flow, leaders are empowered to make informed decisions on the human side of performance and unlock faster execution and higher economic throughput from the organization they already have.

Then I realized – finding all three was like looking for a needle in a wheat field.So, I stopped looking and started reflecting. What I really love—the work that fires me up—is helping leaders and teams find their power and perform at their potential. Across my career, whether I was turning around a struggling nonprofit, helping to scale a cybersecurity firm, working on the Olympics, or running my own business, I kept seeing the same issue:➡️ Companies often put good people in leadership roles without the right training or support.➡️ Those leaders struggle, which leads to frustration, turnover, and wasted potential.➡️ The business suffers, and no one wins. But when companies get it right—when they develop strong leaders, put people in roles that fit their strengths, and create a culture where teams perform. That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees. I do this through leadership coaching, advisory, and fractional executive support, powered by data-driven tools like leadership diagnostics, psychometric assessments, and culture analytics.

When leaders lead themselves, everything changes. You get a team that: • Owns outcomes instead of escalating issues • Stays steady under pressure • Brings solutions, not problems • Thinks with ownership and perspective Ownership isn’t a personality trait. It’s a skill—and it can be built. I spent 21 years in the U.S. Air Force, where self-leadership wasn’t optional—it was expected. When pressure hit, leaders were trusted to handle what belonged to them. After retiring, I saw the same truth play out everywhere: when leaders don’t lead themselves, someone above them has to. That’s why I built the I Lead Me framework—a practical approach that helps leaders manage pressure, make clear choices, and earn trust where it matters most.

Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business.

I take Core Values off the walls and weave them into the fabric your business. Great companies aren’t built by policies. They’re built by people who believe. And that’s where I come in. I don’t just build HR systems, I build belief. I’ve led culture transformations that have taken organizations from fractured to focused, from toxic to thriving, and from stagnant to scalable. My approach blends data-driven strategy with human-centered leadership because you can’t drive performance without first rebuilding trust. Throughout my career, I’ve been the leader called in to fix what’s broken and rebuild what’s possible. 🔹 At a Fortune 500 Company, I inherited the lowest-performing site in the nation — morale was low, turnover was high, and customer satisfaction was just 18%. Eighteen months later, we achieved 92% satisfaction and cut cycle times from 44 days to 18, outperforming the national average. 🔹 At a private sector company, I built HR infrastructure across eight business units, increasing retention by 35%, productivity by 25%, and reducing benefit costs by 15% — while maintaining 100% audit success. Those outcomes weren’t luck — they came from leadership grounded in three guiding principles: 1️⃣ Listen beyond the words — every voice matters. 2️⃣ Lead with strategy and heart — culture is both compass and engine. 3️⃣ Leave people better than you found them.

They struggle because the leadership game they’re winning no longer scales. At a certain point, what made you successful still works but it starts creating friction. - Execution slows. - Decisions pile up. - Effort increases, but impact doesn’t compound the way it used to. That moment is an inflection point. - Nothing is broken. - Performance is strong. - But the rules of the game have changed. Most leaders respond by working harder inside the old game. That usually makes things worse. 📍I work with capable leaders and executive teams at these inflection points when growth requires a different leadership game. My work focuses on helping leaders recognize: 🔸 when they’ve outgrown the game they’re playing 🔸 where their leadership model no longer fits the level of complexity 🔸 and how to update how they think, decide, and operate together so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience This is not a performance problem. It’s not a motivation issue. It’s a leadership operating system mismatch. Where I Focus I work upstream of burnout, reorgs, and stalled execution, helping leaders shift from: • Expert leadership → system-level leadership Designing decision architecture instead of personally solving problems • Alignment by effort → alignment by design Reducing coordination friction and decision latency across teams and stakeholders • Heroic contribution → scalable impact Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not exhaustion Background 20+ years of experience across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, working in complex, global environments where leadership scale and system design matter.

true,true,urn:li:member:58153075,Forrest k.,Derr,,,"You didn’t start your business to run every department. You had a vision. You saw a better way to serve customers, lead people, and grow something meaningful. But somewhere along the way, you became the bottleneck. You’re stuck in the weeds. Solving problems you didn’t cause. Approving decisions you shouldn’t have to make. Every new hire or process adds complexity, not clarity. That’s where I come in. I help Visionaries like you build real businesses, not high-paying jobs. As a Fractional Integrator and COO, I step in as your Second-in-Command. I bring structure to the chaos, create clarity around roles, and build systems that keep your team moving forward without constant input from you. I’ve spent 25+ years doing this across industries: tech, telecom, construction, service, distribution, and several others. I’ve led teams as an VP of Operations, Integrator, President, and COO. Today, I work with companies between $2M and $50M who are scaling fast and feeling the pressure. Most are running on EOS® and have an Implementer™ or graduated from one. Here’s how we work together: 1. Clarify the structure – Clarify your Accountability Chart so everyone knows who owns what. 2. Install discipline – Use tools like scorecards, Rocks, and Meeting Rhythms that actually get traction. 3. Free you to lead – Remove you from day-to-day ops so you can stay in your zone of genius. When the right operational structure is in place, everything changes. You get your time back. Your team gets aligned. And your business becomes something you can grow, scale, or even sell. Let’s turn your company into the business you originally set out to build. Based in Fairhope, AL - Available Nationwide",Integrator & Founder,"If your business feels more like a job than a company, we should talk. Most Founders/Visionaries hit a wall. Growth stalls, chaos creeps in, and the team needs clarity. You want to lead, but you’re buried in decisions, bottlenecks, and burnout. The business is running you and not the other way around. That’s where I come in. As a Fractional COO & Integrator for organizations running on EOS®, I partner with founder-led companies to: • Bring order to the chaos • Build structure that scales • Create clarity and accountability at every level • Drive execution so Visionaries can focus on vision If you’re running on EOS®, I step in to bridge the gap between your Visionary leadership and day-to-day execution. I work seamlessly with Implementers and help drive EOS® through the organization not just at the leadership team level. Not on EOS® yet? I bring proven operational systems from warehousing, telecom, tech, SaaS, and production to help you build a business you can run, not one that runs you. Already have an Integrator or COO? I coach leaders in those seats to help them build confidence, sharpen execution, and align better with their Visionary counterparts. Want your business to stop feeling like a treadmill?

This shapes how I’ve led and built leadership and talent development for 2 decades. In my career, I’ve designed and led leadership development, performance management, and career path initiatives across organizations at different stages of growth. I partner closely with executives, HR leaders, and managers to strengthen the everyday moments that define leadership: setting direction, giving feedback, navigating ambiguity, and supporting people through change. Through FutureForm, I work with leaders and teams to develop three timeless leadership capabilities: Clarity - Helping leaders focus on what matters most and communicate it so teams can move forward with confidence. Connection - Building trust, psychological safety, and real understanding between leaders and their teams. Confidence - Supporting leaders to lead with steadiness and authenticity, without relying on control. Career clarity is a core part of this work. When leaders and employees understand their strengths, values, and direction, performance improves, engagement deepens, and retention follows. Clarity at the individual level strengthens leadership at the organizational level.

Right now, that means independent consulting. I help newly-launched consultants build all the foundational infrastructure they need to run a real business—CRM, website, positioning, client relationship systems—so they can focus on delivering great work without drowning in the business side. My approach is simple: build genuine relationships, not lead funnels. I create systems that help my clients deepen connections with their clients and turn their expertise into sustainable businesses.

Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you.

Archbishop Christie named the school “Columbia University” after the mighty river that flowed nearby, and when it opened its doors, it was staffed with priests from the archdiocese. Columbia University achieved junior college status in 1922, and in 1925 the College of Arts and Sciences was founded. Four years later the first bachelor’s degrees were awarded to a class of seven men. In the 1930s, the University’s name was changed to the University of Portland, the St. Vincent Hospital School of Nursing became part of the University as the College of Nursing, and the School of Business were created. In 1948, the School of Engineering was created. The University established its Graduate School in 1950 and the School of Education in 1962. In 1967 the Congregation of Holy Cross and the University’s Board of Regents transitioned to a shared governance structure.

I also integrate energy healing and somatic stress release techniques into my coaching to help you not only navigate life’s changes but to improve your relationships, deepen your spiritual connection, and increase your presence, happiness, and impact in the world. Together, we’ll clear away the noise and pressure of outside expectations, so you can gain clarity on how you truly want your life to feel. Whether you’re seeking to shift the direction of your life, break free from self-sabotage, or heal your relationship with your body, we’ll peel back the layers and rebuild for a stronger, more joyful life. My mission is to make energy work and higher awareness accessible to everyone—so we can let go of unnecessary conflict and pain and embrace lives of passion, purpose, and true fulfillment.

I help small businesses and nonprofits get aligned before AI, build structure before scale, and create systems that serve people—not the other way around. THE PROBLEM Leaders buy systems before documenting their sales process. They buy automation before clarifying workflow. They chase AI before knowing what problems they're solving. Result? Expensive technology that creates chaos, not clarity. The tech industry profits from this confusion. I don't. ALIGNED BEFORE AI I published a book by this title because I'm tired of watching businesses waste money on premature technology. CLARITY BEFORE COMPLEXITY – Before tools, we clarify what you're trying to accomplish. Until you can articulate this, no software will save you. STRUCTURE BEFORE SCALE – You cannot automate chaos. If processes are broken, AI breaks them faster. We build documented workflows first, then introduce technology. HUMANS BEFORE HYPE – AI amplifies what exists. Confused teams get more confused. Aligned teams become force multipliers. WHAT I'VE BUILT As Founder of Align & Innovate, I provide fractional Chief AI & Systems Officer services to organizations needing strategic technology leadership. Before that, I co-founded Visuals by Momo, helping 50+ nonprofits tell emotionally resonant stories through documentary productions. That taught me: the best technology means nothing if you can't tell a coherent story about what you do. I bring that lens to systems work. Every CRM, every workflow, every AI strategy—it's storytelling. I also host Visual Eyes Podcast, exploring storytelling, technology, and community impact. WHO I WORK WITH Leaders tired of tools that promise transformation but deliver headaches. Leaders ready to invest in foundational systems instead of chasing shiny objects. What I don't do: Sell software you don't need. Build AI that impresses investors but confuses teams. What I do: Ask hard questions. Design systems that reduce friction. Train teams to own tools—not be owned by them.

true,true,urn:li:member:36916412,Tonya,Gossage,,,"I help owner-led businesses scale without burnout by fixing three things: capacity, visibility, and referral-driven growth. When growth stalls, it’s rarely a talent issue. It’s usually a bottleneck, unclear execution, or a visibility gap. I’m a Business Growth Strategist and growth partner to small to mid-size business owners who want to lead like the CEO of their business, not the busiest employee in it. What I do: 1) Capacity (Delegation + Virtual Professionals) I start with a time and workflow audit, then design the proper role and outcomes. Through my Gentask alliance, I can connect you with vetted virtual professionals once the role is clear. Visibility (Free Visibility Audit + SEO strategy): If you’re not getting the leads you should from Google, or you’re paying for marketing but can’t clearly verify outcomes, I’ll run a free visibility (SEO) audit and show you what’s working, what’s missing, and what to fix first. After the audit, if you decide you want to move forward, I will remain as your strategy and accountability lead, my proven SEO implementation team executes the optimization work, and I review the reporting with you, translate what it means, and adjust priorities month-to-month. 3) Referrals (The Power Connectors™) I build referral-first ecosystems where business owners create warm introductions, strategic partnerships, and real deal flow.

I’m a retired police officer, keynote speaker, award-winning author, and family conflict resolution specialist—but more than that, I’m a bridge-builder. Between systems and people. Between leaders and their teams. Between families and the youth they love. After 21 years in law enforcement—including 8.5 years as a School Resource Officer—I’ve seen what happens when people lose connection. I’ve watched families fracture, leaders burn out, teams implode, and kids fall through the cracks. Not because people didn’t care—but because they didn’t know how to lead through the hard stuff. That’s why I created the CALM Leadership Method™—a trust-centered, emotionally intelligent approach to leadership that works in real life. Under pressure. In crisis. In the moments that matter most. I now help corporate teams, educators, frontline professionals, and families lead with connection, rebuild trust where it’s been lost, and communicate clearly when it counts most—at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Whether I’m on stage speaking to executives, equipping frontline teams, or sitting across from a family in conflict, I bring the same message: Connection heals what correction can’t. And if we don’t fix the disconnection, we lose the people who need us most. I’m also the author of the award-winning book Youth Truth: Engaging in Conversations That Can Change Lives—a raw, practical guide that equips parents, educators, and mentors to connect with today’s youth on the tough topics that matter most. It’s not just a book—it’s a bridge between generations, emotions, and relationships. Through real stories, bold truths, and actionable tools, I teach people how to lead with clarity, courage, and compassion—without burning out or checking out. Because when we get connection right, everything changes.

Por eso fundé Estimada Rebel, no como un proyecto más, sino como un movimiento para rediseñar el lugar que ocupamos las mujeres en las empresas: con poder, propósito y autonomía. Hoy, como CEO de Estimada Rebel, diseño e implemento programas de alto impacto como Confident Rebel y Rebel Leader, además de asesorar a organizaciones que buscan transformar sus culturas hacia un liderazgo más inclusivo. A través de nuestro enfoque estratégico, miles de mujeres han fortalecido su confianza, aprendido a comunicar su valor y avanzado hacia puestos de liderazgo con visión, ambición y sin culpa. Mi carrera comenzó mucho antes de emprender. He liderado equipos en GBM, la institución financiera independiente más grande de México, RIU Hotels & Resorts y el British Council, enfrentando de cerca los desafíos de crecer profesionalmente en estructuras donde las decisiones se toman —aún hoy— sin mujeres en la mesa. Esa experiencia no solo afiló mi mirada estratégica, sino que encendió mi convicción: no basta con abrir espacio, hay que preparar a más mujeres para ocuparlo con claridad, autoridad y resultados. Mi formación como Business Coach certificada por Newfield Consulting, bajo la metodología de Rafael Echeverría, y mi especialización en Liderazgo Femenino por Harvard Business School, respaldan una propuesta que integra desarrollo personal, confianza profesional y visión de negocio.

They are expected to be decisive, composed, and constantly available, often while absorbing stress from clients, candidates, partners, and teams. The challenge is not a lack of capability. It is the accumulation. The cost shows up as blurred priorities, reactive decision-making, leadership fatigue, and the quiet sense that there is no place to put the weight you are carrying. Leadership in talent and search can feel grounded, clear, and sustainable without losing edge, credibility, or performance. When we work together, leaders gain clearer judgment under pressure, greater confidence navigating client, candidate, and internal dynamics, and practical tools to manage complexity without constant reactivity.

true,false,urn:li:member:32676434,Norma,Frahn,nsfrahn@gmail.com,7174958450,"I’ve spent my entire career inside HR. But the people I care about most aren’t sitting in corporate boardrooms. They’re running skilled trades and service businesses. They’re out in the field early, managing crews, juggling schedules, solving problems in real time — and doing everything they can to keep the work moving and their people supported. And almost every one of them has said some version of the same thing to me: “I know HR matters… I just don’t have the time. And honestly, I’m not even sure where to start.” That’s exactly why I founded On Demand HR Solutions. Small, growing trades businesses don’t need corporate HR theory or overbuilt policies that don’t fit how the work actually gets done. They need simple, practical HR support — delivered in a way that works alongside the business, not on top of it. That’s where I come in. I work as an independent on-demand HR partner for skilled trades businesses, and I offer a few clear ways to get support, depending on what you need right now: HR SOS Session A focused, one-hour working session to tackle one specific HR issue — a people problem, compliance question, hiring concern, or “this just came up and I need help” situation. HR Blueprint A short-term, hands-on engagement to put the HR foundations in place — clear policies, better hiring and onboarding, and simple systems that bring structure and consistency to how you manage your crew. HR Advisory Ongoing HR support for owners who want a trusted partner in their corner — someone they can call, message, or loop in when questions come up, decisions need to be made, or issues start to surface. No over-engineered solutions. No corporate speak. No judgment. Just honest, practical HR support designed for businesses where the work happens in the field. I believe HR should make running a business easier — not harder. If you’re not sure which option makes sense, that’s okay. Most people aren’t. Send me a message here on LinkedIn and tell me what’s going on. I’ll help you figure out the simplest next step. 📥 Message me on LinkedIn — I’m just one DM away.",Founder & Principal Consultant,"After more than 30 years leading HR in complex corporate environments, I started noticing a pattern. Small, growing skilled trades businesses were being asked to manage the same HR responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, safety, compliance, employee issues — without the time, support, or internal HR teams that larger companies rely on. Most owners don't want to “do HR.” They just wanted the work to run smoothly, their crews supported, and their business protected. So I founded On Demand HR Solutions to meet them where they are. Today, I work as an on-demand HR partner for skilled trades and field-based businesses, helping owners put practical HR systems in place that actually work in real life. My focus is HR operations and people management that supports how trades businesses run day to day. That includes everything from hiring and onboarding crews, to setting clear expectations, handling employee issues, and staying compliant as the business grows. I step in where HR usually falls through the cracks and help bring structure, clarity, and consistency without overcomplicating things. What this looks like in practice: - Acting as the HR department for small trades businesses, providing on-demand guidance, HR administration, and compliance support - Supporting owners through sensitive employee relations issues with a balance of compassion, clarity, and compliance - Building right-sized HR foundations — handbooks, policies, onboarding processes, and basic systems that crews can actually follow - Providing fractional or interim HR support when a business needs experienced HR leadership without hiring full-time - Helping owners move from reactive, day-to-day people issues to more stable, repeatable ways of managing their teams This work allows me to do what I care about most: Making HR feel manageable for business owners who already have enough on their plates — and helping trades businesses grow without the constant stress of “figuring it out as they go.”",2024,https://www.linkedin.com/in/normafrahn,"Glenville, Pennsylvania, United States",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:105839078,On Demand HR Solutions,https://www.linkedin.com/company/on-demand-hr-solutlions/,https://www.ondemandhrsolutions.com/,"Are you trying to run your business but constantly pulled into HR tasks you didn’t sign up for?

Integra’s growth-by-acquisition strategy meant the business—and HR—were always evolving. Every acquisition brought new people, systems, and challenges, giving me the opportunity to reinvent HR over and over again. It often felt like working for a dozen companies within one. In my final role as Head of Global HR Service Delivery, I built and led what became the one-stop-shop for employee support across payroll, benefits, onboarding, leave of absence, employee relations and more. I launched ServiceNow globally, to streamline employee inquiries, reducing response times to under 24 hours, and creating a single source of truth for HR processes. This work supported a dynamic, fast-scaling organization where clear, efficient HR processes were critical. But beyond the systems and processes, what I’m most proud of is how we made HR approachable again—turning a fragmented, confusing experience into one where employees felt supported and leaders had the tools they needed to lead confidently. Earlier, as Head of HR for Corporate Functions, I served as the executive HR partner to C-Suite Finance, IT, Legal, Business Development, and Scientific leaders—supporting them through organization design, restructuring, and workforce planning. I helped leaders build talent strategies, navigate organizational changes, and integrate acquired teams seamlessly into the business. As HR Manager, I supported global operations, quality, regulatory, and commercial sales teams, leading recruitment and retention strategies, launching training programs, and guiding leaders through performance management and employee relations issues.
