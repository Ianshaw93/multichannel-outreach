Through my 5-phase Done-With-You process, we co-create a sanctuary that supports your energy, amplifies your gifts, and attracts aligned clients. ✨ What this looks like: - Visual mapping & design strategy - Trauma-informed, nervous-system-safe coaching - Cyclical productivity tools that honor your flow - Semi-weekly calls with a results-backed guarantee When your space supports you, you can finally do your best work.

Here's what that looks like ↓ >> How it started: A few years ago my CEO said, \"We need you to AI-ify this company.\" I was Chief of Staff. Not a developer. But I knew where the problems were. So I figured it out. Built things. Broke things. Built them better. >> What I learned: While the tech is (still) hard to wrap your head around, getting it to work as hoped and get the ROI you think it should comes from: 1. Understanding what AI can actually do (past the hype) 2. Finding the problems worth solving first 3. Building solutions people actually use >> Who I have helped: - Ops leaders at growth-stage startups - Founders building their first AI workflows for AI-first scaling - RevOps teams buried in manual work - Solopreneurs making AI useful for their business ...all spanning SaaS, talent & recruiting, real estate, non-profits, and more. >> The common thread? Pretty much the same thing every time. They see the AI opportunity. It's obvious something's there. But there's a gap between seeing it and actually using it. That's what I help close. >> How we work together: Learn (build your own capability): → Follow along here - I share what's actually working for me and others! → Subscribe to my newsletter - https://harrysiggins.substack.com/ → Courses - see featured section for cohorts! → Manual Override - an accelerator supporting solopreneurs and fractional execs in building AI-forward businesses (https://www.manualoverride.co/) Build (I work alongside you): → Consulting projects (agents, workflows, and training) → Retainers for ongoing build work and advisory >> What changes: You know what the before looks like. ! AI that seems impressive but doesn't apply to your work. ! A mental list of \"try this\" ideas that never go anywhere. ! Tools you've signed up for and stopped using. ! The feeling that everyone else figured this out already. That's the gap. Seeing the opportunity but not closing it. But once you do: * You know what AI can do for YOUR work in theory AND practice. * You have capability. Skills to do it yourself, systems I built with you, or both. * The next AI opportunity is easier to see and easier to act on because you've done it once now. * You're not someone who talks about AI anymore. You're someone who uses it. * You run an AI-first operation, team, and company. --- DM me or book a call: onetwogrowth.com",
