    "summary": "My journey's been quite a ride: from an Army brat to Military Police, then a police officer, paramedic, Navy spouse, and a business owner for 30 years. All those experiences gave me a unique lens for navigating life's big challenges. And my military dad? He taught me that your word is everything, period. That's always been my North Star. Then came the moment that changed everything. After my husband, Jim, passed away, I found myself in a really vulnerable spot, something I never expected despite my business success. That feeling was a huge wake-up call. I just refused to let anyone else go through that, so I dug in and mastered how to build lasting stability and well-being. My friends say I'm stubborn about everything, and hey, they're not wrong! For over 20 years, I've had the incredible privilege of helping hundreds of families and thousands of folks become their most resilient selves. My passion is empowering the people who truly keep our country going\u2014veterans, folks in rural America, farmers, truckers, and entrepreneurs. I love taking complicated stuff and making it simple, helping people really step into their power. My approach is pretty straightforward: think strategically, make smart choices, and use what you've got effectively. My biggest tip? Consistent, focused effort really does pay off big time in the long run. With six generations of military service in my family, helping those who've served is deeply personal for me. And living out here in rural America, I'm constantly working to help our communities find their footing and build a strong future, generation after generation. You know that saying, \"you are who you spend time with\"? That totally changed how I connect with people. I love bringing clients, experts, and executives together because I really get what makes them tick\u2014their challenges, their dreams, all of it. When I'm not busy helping people create brighter futures, you'll find me on my farm, training horses and dogs. Oh, and get this: at 60, I'm on zero meds and can deadlift almost 300 pounds! It just goes to show you that the same rules apply whether you're building a strong life or a strong body: ditch what doesn't serve you, stay consistent, and nail the basics. That... is the new art of living.",

Instead of running isolated campaigns, we focus on building repeatable systems that create consistent pipeline and momentum over time. Our work is centered around six core systems, deployed based on where growth breaks down. These include AI powered outbound engines, account based intent systems, inbound flow orchestration, CRM activation, content engagement systems, and AI agent orchestration for faster and more consistent execution. Each system is designed to work together as one revenue motion, ensuring that signals are captured, data is usable, and opportunities move forward instead of getting lost. Kinetyca was founded on the belief that revenue becomes predictable when go to market efforts are structured as systems rather than tactics. We combine strategy, tooling, and hands on implementation to help teams move from fragmented execution to clarity and control. We work with B2B startups, scale ups, and revenue teams who want to own their GTM motion, not rely on constant experimentation or manual effort. Our engagements are built around focused 90 day motions. We diagnose what is missing or broken, build and activate only what is needed, and optimize based on real market feedback.

If you had asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answers would have included lawyer, police officer, or doctor. As I got older, I knew those weren't right for me. My career journey has taken me through various sectors, including small to medium-sized businesses, the service industry, a lobbying firm in Washington D.C., a mega-church, and local government. In each organization, I consistently sought to understand the challenges at hand. I asked questions, identified issues, and proposed solutions\u2014some welcomed, others less so. Regardless of the setting, my focus remained on finding the most strategic and logical paths forward. This involved refining existing processes and systems. One recurring theme across all these organizations was a lack of clarity in management and leadership. Employees often struggled with unclear expectations, resulting in low morale and plenty of \u201cwater cooler\u201d conversations post-meetings. Furthermore, genuine people development was frequently overlooked. Through my diverse work experiences and education, I discovered the sweet spot where my skills and passions intersected.

Women served on some committees but, were not allowed to hold office and did not have voting privileges. Because women were paid lower salaries in those days, most women could not afford to join the Greater Fresno Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1950, that all changed. Martha McKinley received permission from the President of the Chamber to form a \u201cWomen\u2019s Section\u201d, with dues more affordable to the working women of that time. They were to have their own Officers and Bylaws. For the next 40 years, the Women\u2019s Section acted as a support group for the Chamber. In 1990 it was time for a change and thus evolved the Fresno County Women\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(6) organization. Our mission is to provide and promote professional opportunities, personal development, financial growth, community leadership and legislative awareness for women.

I want to see the day when workers do not have to go home and consume their dinner and talk about the underdeveloped and unprepared leaders they work for.

Over the past 30 years, I have held numerous executive advisor and senior positions while serving in the United States Navy and civilian sector. Through education and training, I helped strengthen the chain of command and businesses, providing sound decision support and creating open communication at all levels. I also helped formulate and implement policies concerning morale, welfare, job satisfaction, discipline, and training of Navy and civilian personnel. My performance won me the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. I was named 2013, 2014, and 2017 Mentor of the Year, and recipient of the inaugural 2014 Chief John Dungan Jr. Oceanographer of the Navy Award. I was also awarded The Arnold Fletcher Award and inducted into the SALUTE National honors society for my academic achievements.

My clients know that \"soft skills\" are, in fact, hard. They come to us because they want to develop their ACE-Q (=AQ+CQ+EQ). Every organization that ignores the Culture Gap ends up paying for it: through lost revenue, disengaged talent, failed synergies, and missed opportunity. As a leader in a global company you have a choice: Talk to a cross-cultural expert now, or call them when the damage is done. Either way, you'll need to address culture\u2026 because it always shows up. And when it does, it won\u2019t care about your org chart or your P&L. It will simply do what it does: shape behavior, accelerate alignment, or erode value. If you are leading a global team, we should talk: \ud83d\udce9 office@theculturemastery.com Culture is already costing you. You just can\u2019t see it yet. Global leadership without cultural mastery is executive negligence; it\u2019s guessing with high stakes. I am a coach to executive global leaders and a cross-cultural consultant. People book me as a keynote speaker for international events. I am an experienced program facilitator. With my team at \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude06 I help leaders close cultural gaps. Does your organization always meet its global growth goals? Without a solid foundation of cultural competence companies leave money on the table of international business. We help people to work better together across cultures. Our clients have experienced measurable improvements and outrank their competition as a result of our work. TCM cultural training and coaching programs can be designed specifically for business leaders and thought leaders, as well as peace makers and rule makers. When companies work internationally, their employees need to be effective in collaborating with people from cultures which are foreign to them. They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences.

Our clients trust us and rely on us that we lead their employees and their teams to more success across national and cultural borders. We assist in improving business success by providing a variety of services which are targeted at and tailored to increasing productivity when entering new international markets. When companies work internationally and expand outside of their home markets, their employees need to be effective in collaborating with people from cultures which are foreign to them. They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences. Beyond language barriers global professionals are confronted with different behaviors and ways of doing business. Failing to communicate, manage, inspire, and lead across cultural differences is a huge risk for these companies, and the lack of cultural competence can be a bottom-line relevant issue. We help multinational organizations and their employees to work better together across cultures. In an international context, smart business decisions depend on the ability to bridge cultural differences. Employees on every level of the organization need to be able to understand these differences and how to work across cultures. When global leaders fail to adjust and to operate in light of cultural differences, international projects are at risk: Companies lose business due to miscommunication and miss out on international growth opportunities. The central goal of leadership development and cross-cultural learning initiatives by TCM is to establish and develop cross-cultural and leadership competence for your leaders and team members by creating a structured awareness of the impact of culture on all business functions and communications.",

    "summary": "Over the years, I\u2019ve learned that the decisions we make as leaders ripple far beyond the boardroom. They shape careers, cultures, and communities... and, perhaps most importantly, they set an example for the people watching us most closely \u2014 at work, and at home. I\u2019ve worn many hats: CEO, operating executive, advisor, dealmaker, coach, and podcast host. I\u2019ve led sales from $400 million to over $1 billion in an organic growth cycle, delivered 4x growth in six years, navigated more than a dozen acquisitions, and opened new markets. I\u2019ve worked in public companies, private equity-backed businesses, and family-owned enterprises in the middle of steep growth curves. The scale changes, but the through-line is always the same: connect great people, align them around a shared purpose, and give them the space to do their best work. That belief fuels my work at LEAD3R and as host of The Future of Teamwork Podcast, where I\u2019ve interviewed more than 150 leaders from every corner of the working world. Each conversation is a masterclass in leadership - part learning, part teaching, always a reminder that kindness and clarity are not mutually exclusive in high performance. These dialogues sharpen my own leadership style, helping me find new ways to guide teams that are both values-driven and results-focused. I\u2019m endlessly fascinated by the changing shape of tomorrow\u2019s workplace - how technology, community, and business can intersect to tackle big challenges like diversity and inclusion, skills transfer, innovation, and disruption. It\u2019s a space where curiosity is an asset, and collaboration is both art and science. At this point in my career, I know two things for certain: great teams don\u2019t happen by accident, and leadership is a privilege that comes with a responsibility to use it well. If you\u2019re as interested in building purposeful teams and unlocking the potential of people as I am, I\u2019d be glad to connect.",

    "summary": "If you are a CEO, entrepreneur or business owner pursuing mergers or acquisitions as part of your growth strategy, let\u2019s talk. There\u2019s a reason CEO's call me an \"M&A Whisperer\". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the \"unexpected people challenges\" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven\u2019t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, \"NOW WHAT? A Survivor\u2019s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions\" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I\u2019ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I\u2019ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc. Honored as Entrepreneur of the Year by Northshore Women in Business in 2019, I was recently ranked the #1 M&A Leadership Consultant by Leadership Research Institute and nominated to Thinkers50 2024 Radar list of future management thinkers to watch.

    "summary": "I help CEOs and executives move from being \u201coperators who get things done\u201d to being \u201cleaders who create advantage and lasting impact.\u201d Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who\u2019ve been told they \u201cneed to be more strategic.\u201d Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as \u201cnot strategic enough\u201d and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don\u2019t move the organization forward\u2014lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity\u2014noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart\u2014only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional \u201cstrategic planning\u201d that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don\u2019t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers\u2014not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

    "connections": "4952",
    "summary": "Most organizations are built to break under pressure. As complexity grows, roles blur. Trust thins. Decisions stall. Culture becomes a slogan instead of a system. Performance starts to feel like politics. Morale tanks. That\u2019s not a motivation problem. It\u2019s a systems failure. And you can\u2019t fix systems with hype, pulse surveys, or another off-site. You need infrastructure\u2014the kind that scales clarity, trust, and execution without burning your team out. That\u2019s where I come in. I\u2019m a strategic advisor and fractional Chief People Officer. I partner with CEOs and executive teams to build the people infrastructure that makes leadership sustainable\u2014and performance inevitable. What that looks like: \u25aa\ufe0f Executive onboarding that builds trust & traction\u2014not just orientation \u25aa\ufe0f Leadership team development that shifts behavior\u2014not alignment theater \u25aa\ufe0f Culture operating systems that turn values into decisions\u2014not wall art \u25aa\ufe0f Performance architecture that actually gets used\u2014not another abandoned framework I\u2019m typically brought in when: \u25aa\ufe0f Culture and leadership aren\u2019t keeping pace with complexity\u2014showing up in turnover, missed goals, or decision paralysis \u25aa\ufe0f Feedback and performance systems feel fragile or performative \u25aa\ufe0f Legacy habits are blocking next-level execution \u25aa\ufe0f A new exec hire or strategic shift needs to land fast and lead hard My edge? I learned to build systems where failure wasn\u2019t an option. I spent over a decade as a teacher, principal, and system-level education leader\u2014environments where broken systems have immediate consequences. That\u2019s where I learned to design for equity, lead through complexity, and build trust in high-stakes conditions. Now I bring that same pressure-tested lens to companies that can\u2019t afford to get people systems wrong. Recent impact: \u2192 Helped a global nonprofit build shared language and capacity \u2192 Rebuilt performance management from form-filling to real growth conversations \u2192 Guided managing directors through M&A transition at a newly PE-backed firm \u2192 Built strategic roadmap that expanded leadership team impact for a school head Here\u2019s what I know: You don\u2019t fix culture with charisma. You don\u2019t fix performance with perks. You fix them with infrastructure\u2014clear roles, fair processes, and systems that scale trust. When people systems are designed with intention, change doesn\u2019t just happen. It sticks. And it spreads. \ud83d\udc49 https://calendly.com/lfriscia/20-minute-discovery-call Want more thinking like this?

But as organizations grow or shift, the very things that made them successful can start to strain: decisions slow, roles blur, feedback becomes inconsistent, and execution relies on a few people carrying too much. Franca Consulting helps organizations move from scrappy to sustainable by building leadership and talent infrastructure that increases clarity, capacity, and execution \u2014 without burning people out. We partner with CEOs, executive teams, and senior leaders in social enterprise, nonprofits, schools, and purpose-led organizations to strengthen the systems that make leadership work: how decisions get made, how roles are defined, how feedback and learning happen, and how change actually lands. Our work is grounded in a simple belief: most leadership challenges aren\u2019t about effort or commitment \u2014 they\u2019re about infrastructure. How We Work We focus on practical, system-level support that leaders can use immediately, including: -Leadership Infrastructure Diagnostics to surface what\u2019s creating drag and where to focus first -Design & Strategy Sprints to translate priorities into executable plans -Facilitation & Leadership Alignment to build shared language, habits, and decision clarity This is not cookie-cutter solutions or one-off training. It\u2019s infrastructure-building work designed to support both performance and people. When leadership systems are clear and well-designed, leaders don\u2019t have to rely on heroics \u2014 and teams can do their best work sustainably.",

    "summary": "WHAT I DO: For more than 35 years and over 600 engagements, I have rapidly helped companies with revenue $5MM to $50MM fix their cash flow and plan cash flow and operations changes for future profitability. Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher\u2122. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME\u2122) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME\u2122 trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach\u2122 program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)\u2013 because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME\u2122 company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment \u2013 again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours.

    "job_description": "WHY IT MATTERS: Cash flow is the life-blood of your business. When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher\u2122 tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME\u2122 helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME\u2122 gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years. STATISTICS: Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL\u2122 and TAME\u2122 have been able to help financiers recover $1,355,000,000 in debt and saved 13,414 jobs. WHAT I DO: cash flow coaching, turnaround consulting, turnaround management, change company outcomes, restructure debt, refinance distressed companies, sell distressed companies, TAME\u2122, Cash Flow Launcher\u2122, free cash flow model.",

CORPORATE CLIENTS Growing firms don\u2019t (usually!) fail because they lack effort. They stall because clarity and capability don\u2019t keep pace with growth. Resolute helps firms see what actually needs attention, align people and priorities, and develop leaders in ways that change how work gets done. We bring a clear-eyed, both/and perspective - human and business, strategy and execution - to deliver high-quality development that works at the level you need it, whether that\u2019s one leader or the entire firm. The result is stronger leadership, better decisions, and growth that\u2019s intentional instead of reactive. INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS Ambitious professionals don't need more advice - they need clarity, perspective, and a place to think honestly. Resolute works with capable leaders who are navigating bigger expectations, more complexity, and higher stakes, helping them separate the signal from the noise and move forward with both confidence and competence. As a trusted thinking partner, we bring structure, insight, and accountability - balancing challenge and support - to help leaders make better decisions, build real capability, and sustain momentum over time. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS Professional associations succeed when their leaders are prepared, aligned, and confident - and many volunteer leaders aren\u2019t given the development they need to lead well. Resolute partners with associations to design and deliver professional development that respects volunteers\u2019 time, intelligence, and real-world constraints while still creating meaningful growth. Our work is practical, human-centered, and rigorous, helping boards, committees, and cohort participants build the competencies and confidence needed to lead effectively and strengthen the organization as a whole.",

    "summary": "Leadership wasn\u2019t built for a people-first focus. It\u2019s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a \u201csoft skill\u201d into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators \u2013 strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don\u2019t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (\u201cunderstand me, my intent, my stress\u201d) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (\u201clet me understand you first\u201d) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren\u2019t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too \u2026 until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader\u2019s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust\u2014showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to how organizations \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc9a to get work done. I\u2019ve spent years helping companies across banking, finance, healthcare, insurance, and retail adopt modern, agile ways of working, most often at the enterprise level. My work has spanned team-level change to large-scale transformations, helping organizations adopt frameworks like Scrum and Kanban and scale their practices using SAFe and variations of it. I became a \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff\u00ae (\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7) through Scrum Alliance, a designation held by a small number of people worldwide. I\u2019m proud of this accomplishment because it reflects years of real-world experience applying Scrum where it truly fits. I offer public and private Scrum training for teams new to Scrum or that need a reset, because despite new frameworks and trends, Scrum is often still the \ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc95 framework for the \ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc95 teams, when taught well and applied intentionally. Enterprise work has been meaningful but also eye-opening. In big organizations, impact often happens in pockets. A few teams. A department. A pilot. Progress is real but slow, and it\u2019s common to run into walls you can\u2019t move, regardless of experience. That led me to a deliberate shift. I apply everything I\u2019ve learned, what works, what doesn\u2019t, and where organizations get stuck, and apply it to \ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude07\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00, including founders and solopreneurs. This is where decisions matter more, change happens faster, and the impact is immediate. My work now shows up in three primary ways: \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddfa \ud835\udde7\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4: Helping teams build strong foundations and use Scrum thoughtfully, not mechanically. \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd5 & \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4: Helping companies grow revenue, streamline operations, clarify strategy, and align goals to execution. Less chaos. More focus.

Perspective matters. I\u2019ve seen what happens when strategy is disconnected from execution and how powerful it can be when leaders get clear, stay focused, and give teams both structure and agency.

Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can\u2019t live without the benefits today\u2019s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact. At Crowell, business education is designed so you learn and put into practice career-relevant business skills while engaging your faith and launching your career. We invite you to learn more about our School and programs by following us on LinkedIn and going to our web page. Or even better: come by and visit us some time!",

Nearly 19 million people in the US live in \u201cfood deserts\u201d, meaning they don\u2019t live near a grocery store. It\u2019s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I\u2019m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can \u201csee\u201d how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don\u2019t excite them or detract from what they love working on.

It all started with a paradox. Years ago, I went through a difficult period asking myself precisely the questions above. Searching for answers, I discovered that others shared my concerns. As I described it in my first book, I faced a paradox: \"Humanity does not suffer from a lack of answers; rather, it suffers despite the answers being available.\" This paradox became the central quest that led to the start of a new school of psychology: meaningful purpose. Fortunately, I discovered the answers to these existential questions, solved the paradox, and built a practice to help people get the necessary remedies. The point? You, too, can deal with your own paradoxes and benefit by finding the answers to these existential questions. So, if you have big plans and have been giving your all \u2026 YET you are struggling with any of the following \u2026 \u2022 Resistance to your efforts to make a positive difference at work and in social settings. \u2022 Lack of Support preventing you from achieving your professional goals and life dreams. \u2022 Discouragement from trying to bring to life relationships that should thrive but don't. \u2022 Frustration that your contributions are not being acknowledged and appreciated. \u2022 Disappointment with people who are indifferent and unresponsive to your contributions, aspirations, and talent. \u2022 Exhaustion from investing in long hours at work for little to no appreciation. \u2022 Disappointed that your life lacks meaning and direction. But there is hope! The Boston Institute for Meaningful Purpose has something to end the pain. It is called \"Meaning Analysis and Improvement.\" When you harness the \"Meaning Analysis and Improvement\" method, you will \u2026 \u2022 Deepen your self-understanding and of your surroundings. \u2022 Build your self-confidence. \u2022 Discover your strengths and confront your weaknesses courageously for self-improvement. \u2022 Discern what other's agendas and their motives are. \u2022 Know the \"real\" root cause of a problem or situation. \u2022 Understand what your options are and how to select the most promising one.

My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses \u2013 everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s in college and working at one of the Midwest\u2019s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I\u2019ve learned anything along this journey it\u2019s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You\u2019re investing in an established system that\u2019s already successful. You\u2019re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners.

Every organization runs on an invisible operating system => the flow of collaboration, influence, communication, knowledge, and trust that determines how fast work moves and how effectively strategy turns into results. By revealing this hidden system, leaders can see their Employee Relationship Capital: the collective value of employees, and their networks, who accelerate execution, broker trust across silos, and enable influence to flow through relationships that are invisible to org charts. Org design and work can be highly tuned and strategically adapted to fluid, ever-changing conditions. Scenario planning and critical employee decisions are supported by the following: => Which employees are the connectors and bridge builders? => Where does collaboration, communication and influence break down? => Which overly connected employees are at risk of burnout? => Who are the must retain employees? => Who are the sources of innovation and knowledge sharing? => Where do investments in people deliver the highest returns? By measuring how work and information flow, leaders are empowered to make informed decisions on the human side of performance and unlock faster execution and higher economic throughput from the organization they already have.

Margins are tighter. Expectations are higher. And even with capable people around you, you still find yourself stepping in\u2014deciding, fixing, and resolving issues that should never reach your desk. Problems stop getting solved at the right level. Progress slows. And the weight keeps landing on you.

When leaders lead themselves, everything changes. You get a team that: \u2022 Owns outcomes instead of escalating issues \u2022 Stays steady under pressure \u2022 Brings solutions, not problems \u2022 Thinks with ownership and perspective Ownership isn\u2019t a personality trait. It\u2019s a skill\u2014and it can be built. I spent 21 years in the U.S. Air Force, where self-leadership wasn\u2019t optional\u2014it was expected. When pressure hit, leaders were trusted to handle what belonged to them. After retiring, I saw the same truth play out everywhere: when leaders don\u2019t lead themselves, someone above them has to. That\u2019s why I built the I Lead Me framework\u2014a practical approach that helps leaders manage pressure, make clear choices, and earn trust where it matters most.

The foundation\u2019s name, \u201cGIFT,\u201d reflects our core mission: to help individuals Reflect God\u2019s Image and Fulfill their Talent in service to others.

How We Help: At the You Are a GIFT Foundation, we focus on partnering with local organizations and nonprofits to address the unique challenges mothers face on the journey to becoming addiction-free.

Our work is centered on offering a pathway for mothers to rebuild their lives, strengthen their families, and reclaim their purpose.

I\u2019ve led culture transformations that have taken organizations from fractured to focused, from toxic to thriving, and from stagnant to scalable. My approach blends data-driven strategy with human-centered leadership because you can\u2019t drive performance without first rebuilding trust.

Eighteen months later, we achieved 92% satisfaction and cut cycle times from 44 days to 18, outperforming the national average. \ud83d\udd39 At a private sector company, I built HR infrastructure across eight business units, increasing retention by 35%, productivity by 25%, and reducing benefit costs by 15% \u2014 while maintaining 100% audit success.

    "summary": "Most capable leaders don\u2019t struggle because they lack skill. They struggle because the leadership game they\u2019re winning no longer scales. At a certain point, what made you successful still works but it starts creating friction. - Execution slows. - Decisions pile up. - Effort increases, but impact doesn\u2019t compound the way it used to. That moment is an inflection point. - Nothing is broken. - Performance is strong. - But the rules of the game have changed. Most leaders respond by working harder inside the old game. That usually makes things worse. \ud83d\udccdI work with capable leaders and executive teams at these inflection points when growth requires a different leadership game. My work focuses on helping leaders recognize: \ud83d\udd38 when they\u2019ve outgrown the game they\u2019re playing \ud83d\udd38 where their leadership model no longer fits the level of complexity \ud83d\udd38 and how to update how they think, decide, and operate together so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience This is not a performance problem. It\u2019s not a motivation issue. It\u2019s a leadership operating system mismatch. Where I Focus I work upstream of burnout, reorgs, and stalled execution, helping leaders shift from: \u2022 Expert leadership \u2192 system-level leadership Designing decision architecture instead of personally solving problems \u2022 Alignment by effort \u2192 alignment by design Reducing coordination friction and decision latency across teams and stakeholders \u2022 Heroic contribution \u2192 scalable impact Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not exhaustion Background 20+ years of experience across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, working in complex, global environments where leadership scale and system design matter. Former global talent and organizational development leader in Fortune 500 contexts, with deep experience advising senior leaders navigating growth, complexity, and reinvention.

In my career, I\u2019ve designed and led leadership development, performance management, and career path initiatives across organizations at different stages of growth. I partner closely with executives, HR leaders, and managers to strengthen the everyday moments that define leadership: setting direction, giving feedback, navigating ambiguity, and supporting people through change. Through FutureForm, I work with leaders and teams to develop three timeless leadership capabilities: Clarity - Helping leaders focus on what matters most and communicate it so teams can move forward with confidence. Connection - Building trust, psychological safety, and real understanding between leaders and their teams. Confidence - Supporting leaders to lead with steadiness and authenticity, without relying on control. Career clarity is a core part of this work. When leaders and employees understand their strengths, values, and direction, performance improves, engagement deepens, and retention follows. Clarity at the individual level strengthens leadership at the organizational level.

And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: \u2013 10 clients signed \u2013 2 interns hired \u2013 $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don\u2019t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you\u2019re that kind of founder, we\u2019d love to work with you. Let\u2019s build something that lasts.",

My summary used to be the same-old rote descriptions of all the things I thought I was. It included words like \"strategic\", \"collaborator\", \"leadership-driven\", \"people-centric\", and so on\u2026 I AM all those things but what about the PERSON behind the ROLE? Where did she go, I wonder? Well, a COMPLETE burnout in HR during the pandemic and two, yes two, subsequent layoffs in two years, I'm finally free of the constraints our modern workplace norms have become. I would now describe myself as a former Human Resource professional who woke up one day and had enough of the games, the politicking, working the grind for someone else only to be a cog in the wheel. It became untenable. I was reminded that we really can only control the \"controllables\"... ... how we respond to change, the integrity with which we handle ourselves, how we manage our home & finances, how we take care of and love those who we love, and ultimately where/when/how we steward the gifts and time we've been given. Jobs will come and go but who you are in the in-between matters most. I recently read a famous quote that made my stomach turn and my pulse race ...\"The majority of people die at 35 but aren't buried until 75\" - I see what this represents all around me and have my whole career. People on autopilot, no self-reflecting, not thriving, not clear on their God-given purpose and direction. I believe God wants better for you and for me.

As the founder of InterConcept Inc. and Menn\u00e4 Life, I have guided numerous businesses through the complexities of sourcing, design, and production, ensuring they have high-quality products that resonate with their target audience. From concept development and private labeling to global sourcing and manufacturing logistics, I provide comprehensive solutions that make the entire process seamless. In addition, I act as a local agent for overseas manufacturing, bridging the gap between brands and international suppliers. I ensure that every step of the process\u2014from sourcing materials to final production\u2014is handled with precision and care, providing you with peace of mind that your product is being developed efficiently and to the highest standards. Whether you're an emerging startup looking to develop your first product or an established brand seeking to expand your line, I offer the expertise, network, and strategic insight needed to deliver results. In addition to my product development work, I am also a certified life coach specializing in energy healing. I teach individuals how to access their inner world of energy awareness and use this awareness to self-discover their outer material world.

I help leaders and organizations navigate complexity when the path forward isn\u2019t fully visible \u2014 strengthening judgment, sense-making, and decision-making as the terrain shifts. My work sits at the intersection of strategy, leadership, and human judgment. I support organizations facing high-stakes decisions shaped by uncertainty, competing priorities, organizational change, and rapid technology shifts \u2014 including AI. Through 8Ball Clarity, I work with leadership teams on strategic clarity, decision-making, and alignment when execution alone isn\u2019t the problem. My role is to slow thinking down just enough to create clarity \u2014 and then help people move forward with confidence. As a Fractional Chief Strategy Officer with Scarlett Nova, I help organizations move from AI curiosity to responsible, value-creating adoption. This includes shaping AI strategy, governance, and decision frameworks that account for human readiness, risk, timing, and system-level impact \u2014 not just tools. I\u2019m an engineer-turned-people executive and strategist, with experience spanning manufacturing, supply chain, enterprise risk, digital transformation, and organizational development. I\u2019m industry-agnostic by design, enabling cross-pollination of insight across systems. I also host The Generalist Advantage podcast because the world needs more of their superpowers.

Dr. Andy uniquely emphasizes a positive psychology approach that utilizes established individual, familial, and organizational strengths rather than underscoring what may be pathological or dysfunctional. In blending this approach with a systems theoretical model, existential psychology, and solution-focused strategies, he's empowered to provide a transformative brand of coaching and consulting. Throughout his career, he\u2019s contributed a significant and meaningful role as a consultant for multiple faith-based organizations - where he specializes in empowering his clients to discover and establish their True North identity, purpose, and community - and then integrate radically resilient principles, practices, and strategies - that enable his clients to consistently achieve their biggest goals and actualize their greatest potential. Dr. Andy has made a considerable impact working as a performance coach for high performing executives, elite athletes, and organizations throughout Southern California - and beyond (his online coaching curriculum has been effectively utilized and taught throughout the US - and even in select European countries). Dr. Andy has developed a thriving private practice in the renowned Newport Beach area, and he offers custom private workshops, corporate training programs, he is a highly sought after speaker and podcast guest, and he continues to offer concierge style coaching services (although - openings with Dr. Andy are rare to come by - so, if you are interested in working with him one on one - you should get on his waiting list ASAP!).",

I help small businesses and nonprofits get aligned before AI, build structure before scale, and create systems that serve people\u2014not the other way around. THE PROBLEM Leaders buy systems before documenting their sales process. They buy automation before clarifying workflow. They chase AI before knowing what problems they're solving. Result? Expensive technology that creates chaos, not clarity. The tech industry profits from this confusion. I don't. ALIGNED BEFORE AI I published a book by this title because I'm tired of watching businesses waste money on premature technology. CLARITY BEFORE COMPLEXITY \u2013 Before tools, we clarify what you're trying to accomplish. Until you can articulate this, no software will save you. STRUCTURE BEFORE SCALE \u2013 You cannot automate chaos. If processes are broken, AI breaks them faster. We build documented workflows first, then introduce technology. HUMANS BEFORE HYPE \u2013 AI amplifies what exists. Confused teams get more confused. Aligned teams become force multipliers. WHAT I'VE BUILT As Founder of Align & Innovate, I provide fractional Chief AI & Systems Officer services to organizations needing strategic technology leadership. Before that, I co-founded Visuals by Momo, helping 50+ nonprofits tell emotionally resonant stories through documentary productions. That taught me: the best technology means nothing if you can't tell a coherent story about what you do. I bring that lens to systems work. Every CRM, every workflow, every AI strategy\u2014it's storytelling. I also host Visual Eyes Podcast, exploring storytelling, technology, and community impact. WHO I WORK WITH Leaders tired of tools that promise transformation but deliver headaches. Leaders ready to invest in foundational systems instead of chasing shiny objects. What I don't do: Sell software you don't need. Build AI that impresses investors but confuses teams. What I do: Ask hard questions. Design systems that reduce friction.

The World Bank estimates that 40 percent of the global population lives in places of high vulnerability to climate change. \"Business as usual\" investing could put asset owners at risk of not meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, being misaligned with rapidly evolving regulations/guidelines or simply being out of touch with their stakeholders\u2019 sustainability convictions.

Each brand is built to empower leaders to think bigger, operate smarter, and move with confidence toward their vision.

I\u2019m a retired police officer, keynote speaker, award-winning author, and family conflict resolution specialist\u2014but more than that, I\u2019m a bridge-builder. Between systems and people. Between leaders and their teams. Between families and the youth they love. After 21 years in law enforcement\u2014including 8.5 years as a School Resource Officer\u2014I\u2019ve seen what happens when people lose connection. I\u2019ve watched families fracture, leaders burn out, teams implode, and kids fall through the cracks. Not because people didn\u2019t care\u2014but because they didn\u2019t know how to lead through the hard stuff. That\u2019s why I created the CALM Leadership Method\u2122\u2014a trust-centered, emotionally intelligent approach to leadership that works in real life. Under pressure. In crisis. In the moments that matter most. I now help corporate teams, educators, frontline professionals, and families lead with connection, rebuild trust where it\u2019s been lost, and communicate clearly when it counts most\u2014at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Whether I\u2019m on stage speaking to executives, equipping frontline teams, or sitting across from a family in conflict, I bring the same message: Connection heals what correction can\u2019t. And if we don\u2019t fix the disconnection, we lose the people who need us most. I\u2019m also the author of the award-winning book Youth Truth: Engaging in Conversations That Can Change Lives\u2014a raw, practical guide that equips parents, educators, and mentors to connect with today\u2019s youth on the tough topics that matter most. It\u2019s not just a book\u2014it\u2019s a bridge between generations, emotions, and relationships. Through real stories, bold truths, and actionable tools, I teach people how to lead with clarity, courage, and compassion\u2014without burning out or checking out.

    "company_description": "Leaders in executive search and talent acquisition spend their days advising others, managing expectations, navigating pressure, and holding complex human dynamics. They are expected to be decisive, composed, and constantly available, often while absorbing stress from clients, candidates, partners, and teams. The challenge is not a lack of capability. It is the accumulation. The cost shows up as blurred priorities, reactive decision-making, leadership fatigue, and the quiet sense that there is no place to put the weight you are carrying. Leadership in talent and search can feel grounded, clear, and sustainable without losing edge, credibility, or performance. When we work together, leaders gain clearer judgment under pressure, greater confidence navigating client, candidate, and internal dynamics, and practical tools to manage complexity without constant reactivity. The result is steadiness that carries into teams, clients, and decisions. This work supports leaders who are already strong and want to lead with greater clarity, presence, and meaningful connection, particularly in complex, high-pressure environments. I have spent my career in executive search and talent acquisition. I understand the pace, the pressure, and the unspoken expectations that shape this work. My coaching blends leadership experience, talent expertise, and a structured, human-centered approach for leaders who do not need theory. They need clarity. I bring over two decades of experience working alongside senior leaders in executive search, recruiting, and people-driven organizations, including scaling and leading global search operations for a PE-backed talent advisory firm through organic and M&A growth. If this resonates with you or your team, I invite you to schedule a confidential conversation to explore whether coaching support would be useful right now.",

They\u2019re out in the field early, managing crews, juggling schedules, solving problems in real time \u2014 and doing everything they can to keep the work moving and their people supported. And almost every one of them has said some version of the same thing to me: \u201cI know HR matters\u2026 I just don\u2019t have the time. And honestly, I\u2019m not even sure where to start.\u201d That\u2019s exactly why I founded On Demand HR Solutions. Small, growing trades businesses don\u2019t need corporate HR theory or overbuilt policies that don\u2019t fit how the work actually gets done. They need simple, practical HR support \u2014 delivered in a way that works alongside the business, not on top of it. That\u2019s where I come in. I work as an independent on-demand HR partner for skilled trades businesses, and I offer a few clear ways to get support, depending on what you need right now: HR SOS Session A focused, one-hour working session to tackle one specific HR issue \u2014 a people problem, compliance question, hiring concern, or \u201cthis just came up and I need help\u201d situation. HR Blueprint A short-term, hands-on engagement to put the HR foundations in place \u2014 clear policies, better hiring and onboarding, and simple systems that bring structure and consistency to how you manage your crew. HR Advisory Ongoing HR support for owners who want a trusted partner in their corner \u2014 someone they can call, message, or loop in when questions come up, decisions need to be made, or issues start to surface. No over-engineered solutions. No corporate speak. No judgment. Just honest, practical HR support designed for businesses where the work happens in the field. I believe HR should make running a business easier \u2014 not harder. If you\u2019re not sure which option makes sense, that\u2019s okay. Most people aren\u2019t.

    "job_description": "After more than 30 years leading HR in complex corporate environments, I started noticing a pattern. Small, growing skilled trades businesses were being asked to manage the same HR responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, safety, compliance, employee issues \u2014 without the time, support, or internal HR teams that larger companies rely on. Most owners don't want to \u201cdo HR.\u201d They just wanted the work to run smoothly, their crews supported, and their business protected. So I founded On Demand HR Solutions to meet them where they are. Today, I work as an on-demand HR partner for skilled trades and field-based businesses, helping owners put practical HR systems in place that actually work in real life. My focus is HR operations and people management that supports how trades businesses run day to day. That includes everything from hiring and onboarding crews, to setting clear expectations, handling employee issues, and staying compliant as the business grows. I step in where HR usually falls through the cracks and help bring structure, clarity, and consistency without overcomplicating things. What this looks like in practice: - Acting as the HR department for small trades businesses, providing on-demand guidance, HR administration, and compliance support - Supporting owners through sensitive employee relations issues with a balance of compassion, clarity, and compliance - Building right-sized HR foundations \u2014 handbooks, policies, onboarding processes, and basic systems that crews can actually follow - Providing fractional or interim HR support when a business needs experienced HR leadership without hiring full-time - Helping owners move from reactive, day-to-day people issues to more stable, repeatable ways of managing their teams This work allows me to do what I care about most: Making HR feel manageable for business owners who already have enough on their plates \u2014 and helping trades businesses grow without the constant stress of \u201cfiguring it out as they go.\u201d",

    "previous_job_description": "While my title at Integra LifeSciences changed over 16 years, the constant was transformation. Integra\u2019s growth-by-acquisition strategy meant the business\u2014and HR\u2014were always evolving. Every acquisition brought new people, systems, and challenges, giving me the opportunity to reinvent HR over and over again. It often felt like working for a dozen companies within one. In my final role as Head of Global HR Service Delivery, I built and led what became the one-stop-shop for employee support across payroll, benefits, onboarding, leave of absence, employee relations and more. I launched ServiceNow globally, to streamline employee inquiries, reducing response times to under 24 hours, and creating a single source of truth for HR processes. This work supported a dynamic, fast-scaling organization where clear, efficient HR processes were critical. But beyond the systems and processes, what I\u2019m most proud of is how we made HR approachable again\u2014turning a fragmented, confusing experience into one where employees felt supported and leaders had the tools they needed to lead confidently. Earlier, as Head of HR for Corporate Functions, I served as the executive HR partner to C-Suite Finance, IT, Legal, Business Development, and Scientific leaders\u2014supporting them through organization design, restructuring, and workforce planning. I helped leaders build talent strategies, navigate organizational changes, and integrate acquired teams seamlessly into the business. As HR Manager, I supported global operations, quality, regulatory, and commercial sales teams, leading recruitment and retention strategies, launching training programs, and guiding leaders through performance management and employee relations issues. Integra was where I learned to thrive in ambiguity, manage change without losing sight of people, and ensure HR always aligned with the evolving needs of the business.",
