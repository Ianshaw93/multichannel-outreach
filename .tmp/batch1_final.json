I’m a Fractional Futurist, helping fractional executives build million-dollar firms they can scale and eventually exit. Going from 0–1 is hard. Shifting from freelancer to founder is harder. That’s where I come in—with strategy, structure, and the FROST Framework. I’m the co-founder of yorCMO, the first decentralized leadership franchise for fractional CMOs. And now, I’m scaling FractionalPros.com, a platform that connects SMBs with vetted fractional leaders—and helps those leaders find visibility, leads, and community through niche-driven peer pods. I believe in decentralized teams, strategic clarity, and the idea that every expert deserves a business model that works for them, not just because of them. I’ve had a non-linear career and life. I’ve: - Started a lawn care service in high school and sold the business before college - Studied and worked in chemical engineering - Founded 4 companies: from mortgage financing to media to data haptics tech - Published and written a book on media habits - Taught Entrepreneurship to university students - Created a documentary film on the seasons of entrepreneurship - Launched a community for fractional pros I spent years attempting to reconcile my wildly diverse experiences, let alone trying to explain them to those around me. Eventually, I realized that my decentralized nature was an asset: I could help other entrepreneurs engineer non-traditional, weird, unexpected and creative ideas into their businesses. Often it’s the simplest ideas that have the power to make a big impact & combust at scale. Board Member at Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) Nebraska.

Leaders and HR partners tell me the same thing: “We know collaboration matters—but we can’t measure it, sustain it, or scale it.” That’s where the TIGERS® 6 Principles System comes in. It equips leaders and HR partners to turn AI-driven flattening into a human advantage through measurable trust, collaboration, and engagement. For more than 30 years, I’ve helped organizations—from Fortune 500s to nonprofits—create high-trust, self-aligning cultures that thrive in complexity.

They’re behavioral metrics that leaders can observe, measure, and scale. That’s why we license this framework to coaches, consultants, and HR partners who want to deliver sustainable, people-centered transformation that makes work easier not harder.

    "summary": "My journey's been quite a ride: from an Army brat to Military Police, then a police officer, paramedic, Navy spouse, and a business owner for 30 years. All those experiences gave me a unique lens for navigating life's big challenges. And my military dad? He taught me that your word is everything, period. That's always been my North Star. Then came the moment that changed everything. After my husband, Jim, passed away, I found myself in a really vulnerable spot, something I never expected despite my business success. That feeling was a huge wake-up call. I just refused to let anyone else go through that, so I dug in and mastered how to build lasting stability and well-being. My friends say I'm stubborn about everything, and hey, they're not wrong! For over 20 years, I've had the incredible privilege of helping hundreds of families and thousands of folks become their most resilient selves. My passion is empowering the people who truly keep our country going—veterans, folks in rural America, farmers, truckers, and entrepreneurs. I love taking complicated stuff and making it simple, helping people really step into their power. My approach is pretty straightforward: think strategically, make smart choices, and use what you've got effectively. My biggest tip? Consistent, focused effort really does pay off big time in the long run. With six generations of military service in my family, helping those who've served is deeply personal for me. And living out here in rural America, I'm constantly working to help our communities find their footing and build a strong future, generation after generation. You know that saying, \"you are who you spend time with\"? That totally changed how I connect with people. I love bringing clients, experts, and executives together because I really get what makes them tick—their challenges, their dreams, all of it. When I'm not busy helping people create brighter futures, you'll find me on my farm, training horses and dogs. Oh, and get this: at 60, I'm on zero meds and can deadlift almost 300 pounds! It just goes to show you that the same rules apply whether you're building a strong life or a strong body: ditch what doesn't serve you, stay consistent, and nail the basics. That... is the new art of living.",

Executive leaders in global organizations work with me because they know that by identifying, addressing, and minimizing the Culture Gap they get better at what they do. International frustration slows, their business growths, success shows. Ready to talk? 📩 GetStarted@TheCultureMastery.com German by birth, American by choice, and Bavarian at heart, I am a fan of building bridges - across cultures - and not enthusiastic about walls. My clients know that \"soft skills\" are, in fact, hard. They come to us because they want to develop their ACE-Q (=AQ+CQ+EQ). I am a coach to executive global leaders and a cross-cultural consultant. People book me as a keynote speaker for international events. I am an experienced program facilitator, certified to work with the GlobeSmart Profile, the Inclusive Behaviors Inventory, the AQai assessment, and the CodeBreaker.BANKcode personality profile. I am also an NLP Master trainer. With my team at The Culture Mastery I help leaders close cultural gaps. Does your organization always meet its global growth goals? Without a solid foundation of cultural competence companies leave money on the table of international business. For more than a decade our clients have experienced measurable improvements and outrank their competition when it comes to structuring, leading, and communicating across cultures. I am a strong believer that any conflict can be resolved with a better understanding of our cultures. And as a German, burdened with the inherited guilt of the most horrific crime against humanity, it is my duty and moral obligation to make our world a more peaceful, responsible place. Our cultural training and coaching programs can be designed specifically for business leaders and thought leaders, as well as peace makers and rule makers. At The Culture Mastery we help people to work better together across cultures. When companies work internationally, their employees need to be effective in collaborating with people from cultures which are foreign to them. They need to be able to sell and market to customers with unfamiliar consumption preferences. Failing to communicate, manage, inspire, and lead across cultural differences is a huge risk for these companies, and the lack of cultural competence can be a bottom-line relevant issue.",

Our vision is for a more peaceful world and we accomplish this by helping people from different cultures understand each other better. We don’t deliver training & development widgets; we help you attain a higher level of cultural awareness and competence. By mastering cultural transitions, you will be at peak performance in the global community. At The Culture Mastery, all team members have crossed cultures at least once in their lives. We serve the global business community with four main services: • Cultural Training & Coaching: In an international context, smart business decisions depend on the ability to bridge cultural differences. Team members need to be able to understand these differences and how to work across cultures. • Global Leadership Development: As leaders grow into their international roles, the skills which got them into their position will not be the same skills which will propel their global career. Smart executives learn how to lead in a global context. • Expat Services: When international employees take on assignments abroad, the challenges of relocation can make or break the project. Our Destination Services ease the pain of the mundane. • Language Support: Your global business can easily get lost in translation. While you master the culture, you don’t want to neglect your company’s language skills. Masterful communication is critical for global success.",

They shape careers, cultures, and communities... and, perhaps most importantly, they set an example for the people watching us most closely — at work, and at home. I’ve worn many hats: CEO, operating executive, advisor, dealmaker, coach, and podcast host. I’ve led sales from $400 million to over $1 billion in an organic growth cycle, delivered 4x growth in six years, navigated more than a dozen acquisitions, and opened new markets. I’ve worked in public companies, private equity-backed businesses, and family-owned enterprises in the middle of steep growth curves. The scale changes, but the through-line is always the same: connect great people, align them around a shared purpose, and give them the space to do their best work. That belief fuels my work at LEAD3R and as host of The Future of Teamwork Podcast, where I’ve interviewed more than 150 leaders from every corner of the working world. Each conversation is a masterclass in leadership - part learning, part teaching, always a reminder that kindness and clarity are not mutually exclusive in high performance. These dialogues sharpen my own leadership style, helping me find new ways to guide teams that are both values-driven and results-focused. I’m endlessly fascinated by the changing shape of tomorrow’s workplace - how technology, community, and business can intersect to tackle big challenges like diversity and inclusion, skills transfer, innovation, and disruption. It’s a space where curiosity is an asset, and collaboration is both art and science. At this point in my career, I know two things for certain: great teams don’t happen by accident, and leadership is a privilege that comes with a responsibility to use it well. If you’re as interested in building purposeful teams and unlocking the potential of people as I am, I’d be glad to connect.",

    "summary": "If you are a CEO, entrepreneur or business owner pursuing mergers or acquisitions as part of your growth strategy, let’s talk. There’s a reason CEO's call me an \"M&A Whisperer\". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the \"unexpected people challenges\" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, \"NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions\" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc. Honored as Entrepreneur of the Year by Northshore Women in Business in 2019, I was recently ranked the #1 M&A Leadership Consultant by Leadership Research Institute and nominated to Thinkers50 2024 Radar list of future management thinkers to watch.

    "summary": "I'm not an exit consultant. I help owners build businesses they never want to sell. (Ironically, that's exactly when buyers pay the most.) Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: \"I can't take a real vacation without chaos\" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: \"I need to scale but organic growth is too slow\" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: \"I want options but don't know where to start\" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: \"It's time. Get me the best outcome possible\" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison. Multiple options = freedom. 📊 Find out where you stand: Send me a message and let's talk about where you are and where you want to be. 📚 Or start with my book: \"Unlocking Small Business Value\" The playbook I wish I'd had for my first acquisition: https://grw.bz/unlock P.S.

    "connections": "6006",
    "summary": "I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it. How I Can Help: ▶ CEO Coaching: Personalized coaching for CEOs and Business Unit leaders of 8+ figure businesses, designed to build robust systems for success. ▶ Consulting: Strategy and consulting services for Fortune 500-1000 companies, including strategy development, digital transformation, M&A support, and performance improvement initiatives. ▶ Online Training Programs: 💡 Strategic Thinking For Advantage: A program for aspiring executives to sharpen their strategic skills. 🏆 Win Your Day: An online course sharing my productivity system to help you become more effective.",

Is your vision for growth failing to inspire enthusiastic followership? Do your ideas get brushed aside? Are strategic misalignments and execution uncertainties sapping your team’s energy and direction? Imagine pinpointing your next $10-$100 million in revenue, with your team aligned and clear on their future goals, and where your leadership is heard and understood. The challenge often lies in clinging to outdated strategies. For years, your teams have been incentivized to keep what’s in place going. Anything ‘new’ might get in the way, add risk, or slow things down. They don’t see that one of the greatest risks in business today is not adapting on purpose and by design. With over 25+ years of experience in pioneering first-of-their-kind projects, I’ve driven over $2 billion in unprecedented sales growth through strategic market entries, service expansions, and enhanced customer experiences. I also fueled over $500 million in sales by repositioning brands, crafting exit valuation stories, and unlocking new channels and opportunities. Consultants come and go, but Mike’s commitment to our growth has been unwavering since he helped us redefine our brand. Mike empowered us to become the brand we aspired to be, giving us permission to jettison the limiting preconceptions.

As Founder of Haas Strategy Solutions, I bring more than 40 years of management consulting experience across nonprofits, professional services, manufacturing, healthcare, defense, and emerging technology. My work complements internal planning by offering independent perspective, structured strategy processes, and an ethics lens that ensures decisions are resilient as well as ambitious. My career began in ecology and systems modeling, then expanded into public policy and decades of advising leaders at the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research, international science programs, and economic development institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Across these roles, I learned that organizations succeed or falter not only on technical brilliance, but on how well they align strategy, ecosystems, and ethics. That philosophy drives Haas Strategy Solutions today. My services focus on three core offerings: • Strategy Red Team — an independent second opinion that surfaces blind spots, challenges assumptions, and tests resilience before major commitments are made. • Strategy Foundation — a diagnostic and design process that clarifies mission, business model, and performance systems, giving leaders a stronger base for growth. • Strategy Stress Test — scenario-based evaluation of resilience under disruption, whether from technology, regulation, competition, or economic shocks. I also advise organizations working at the frontier of emerging technology—including AI, quantum computing, biotech, defense, energy, and advanced manufacturing. I help translate technical roadmaps into organizational clarity: mapping ecosystems, planning for scarce talent, designing commercialization pathways, and embedding ethics and governance as strategic differentiators. For 20 years, I also served as an ethics officer, which taught me that foresight and trust are not optional. In fields from personalized medicine to AI, ignoring ethics until too late has slowed adoption and triggered regulation. By contrast, organizations that anticipate these issues build legitimacy faster and endure longer.",

Throughout my career, I’ve been the first HR executive at organizations navigating growth, change, or transition—brought in to assess what exists, identify what’s missing, and design people strategies that scale. I don’t need an existing playbook. I evaluate, reimagine, and implement systems that align culture with growth and ensure people feel valued, supported, and seen.

Through my firm, People Solutions Group, I advise CEOs, founders, and investors on how to align people strategy with business goals—whether they’re navigating a merger, restructuring, or preparing to scale. I also serve as faculty with the Human Capital Institute, where I facilitate programs in Strategic HR Business Partnership, Strategic Talent Acquisition, Workforce Planning, Change Management, and People Analytics—helping HR and business leaders grow their capability, confidence, and influence.

I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs.

This firm was created to leverage my prior experience to assist business owners as a long-term trusted advisor in the business financial arena. My passion is coaching business leaders to grow revenue, margin, profit, cash flow and ultimately the value of their companies. Whether this is for a 120-year-old multi-generational family legacy company or a startup with a great idea and in need of capital, I serve the gap between the owners, CEO and finance team. I have expertise in growing companies, preparing them for a sale transition and obtaining capital and optimal debt structure. During my career I have worked with hundreds of business enterprises and provided counsel to buyers and sellers of companies to maximize the value and resulting after tax cash. My career has allowed me to train internal staff, identifying required staff and sourcing and selecting candidates ranging from entry level staff to senior C suite finance executives. I offer this service to clients who need assistance in building a strong team. My passion in working with business owners has been the culmination of preparing the business for sale and successfully transitioning the ownership, with the rewards optimized for the seller. Exit Planning strategy and execution are also areas of my expertise and business transition training. As both a C-Level executive and owner of businesses for the past 35 years I am skilled at running companies and adding value to organizations. As an entrepreneurial and analytical CFO advisor I have started and run companies as well as taken existing companies and improved the processes, procedures and profitability. My approach is to demonstrate a practical problem solving methodology while creating a team of skilled and motivated business associates in the process.",

    "summary": "Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

    "summary": "Over the past 15 years, I’ve partnered with C-suite executives, leadership teams, and fast-growing companies who are: Frustrated by inconsistent performance: high performers doing well, but many others unclear on priorities—and the gap between intention and results widening Struggling with leadership transitions: new roles, new teams, or scaling leadership layers without losing clarity or accountability Experiencing “culture drift”: when stated values are no longer lived out, morale is slipping, or misalignment is undermining collaboration and innovation Bewildered by performance systems that don’t motivate: annual reviews that feel like paperwork, metrics that don’t tie to behavior, or feedback processes that don’t stick 💪What I Do: I’m one of a small group of certified professionals who use a proprietary framework to tackle these hurdles. 🔍 Leadership Development – I work with individuals and teams to sharpen self-awareness, decision-making, and influence. Whether it's coaching new leaders or retooling executive thinking for a changing business landscape, I help people lead with clarity and confidence. 🌐 Culture Alignment – I help define, refresh or re-center organizational culture so it becomes an asset rather than a liability. That means making values visible, integrating them into day-to-day behaviors, and ensuring culture supports strategy, not fights it. 📈 Performance Management – I design performance systems that align everyone—from the front line to the C-suite—with business goals. That could include goal-setting frameworks, feedback loops, accountability structures, or measurement of progress in real time. What Clients Gain: ✅Clarity & consistency in leadership: everyone pulling in the same direction, with purpose ✅A culture that supports innovation, engagement & ethical decision-making ✅Performance systems that inspire and hold people accountable—with measurable results ✅More humility + higher trust in leadership; less friction, fewer reworks, quicker decision cycles Why Work With Me: Because I believe real change happens when leadership, culture, and performance systems are fully aligned—and when they are, companies don’t just function better—they become more resilient, more adaptive, and more trusted by their people and stakeholders. 🔗 If you’re a leader or executive ready to close gaps in leadership, culture or performance—and want concrete results rather than vague promises—let’s have a conversation.

My career has taken me from founding a tech company at 19 to leading innovation labs, launching global brands, and creating content that inspires others to rediscover themselves through motorcycles, creativity, and community. Today, I split my time between business and storytelling — as a marketing strategist, content creator, and mental health advocate. I’m the founder and face behind Zen Motorcycle Maintenance, a community of over 160,000 riders and a reach of more than 10 million monthly views, where I explore the intersection of motorcycles, philosophy, and mental health. I’m an official ambassador for Royal Enfield Motorcycles (and their Himalayan 450) and Cardo Systems, and I’ve collaborated with industry leaders including Honda, QuadLock, Biltwell, and Hedon Helmets. My work extends beyond the screen — leading rides, speaking at events, and creating experiences that remind riders to maintain their minds as well as their machines. As the author of The MotoJournal and creator of the Spark Unplugged personal growth program, I help people reconnect with their creativity, purpose, and balance in a hyper-connected world. Before this chapter, I served as Chief Marketing Officer at Auper Motorcycles, leading global strategy for an electric motorcycle startup, and as Head of Corporate Innovation at The Accelerator Centre, where I built programs connecting corporations with startups to pilot and commercialize new technologies. I’ve also founded and led three major innovation labs — in Kitchener, Halifax, and Toronto — partnering with government, academia, and industry to push what’s possible. I’ve spent my career proving that creativity, technology, and humanity belong together. Whether it’s developing new ventures, mentoring founders, or crafting stories that inspire, my goal is always the same — to build things that make people think, feel, and grow.

What sets me apart is the balance I bring: • A practical, analytical mind — grounded in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt level), and a PhD in chemistry • A calm, human presence — able to surface hidden tensions, build trust, and mobilise teams around shared purpose • A strategic posture — focused on results that are both measurable and lasting • A practitioner-researcher mindset — where curiosity fuels continuous learning and deepens the value of my work for clients I bring a strong foundation in operational realities — from the shop floor to senior leadership — combined with certifications in Lean Six-Sigma, Human Centered Design, Executive and Team Coaching, as well as diagnostic tools in Team 360, change leadership and resiliency. In person or virtually, I partner with leadership teams to align with clarity, move forward with cohesion, and generate strategic momentum that lasts.

Our approach is grounded in over 20 years of experience leading high-stakes initiatives in both the private and public sectors. It’s strengthened by deep expertise in systems thinking, Lean Six Sigma (Master Black Belt), human-centred design, and a rigorous scientific foundation (PhD in chemistry). What we’ve learned — time and again — is that no strategy, however robust, leads to sustainable change without healthy team dynamics. As Drucker said, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” That’s why we approach every engagement through a dual lens: cross-functional collaboration and relational depth. Because lasting transformation isn’t driven by plans alone — it’s carried by the people who bring them to life. You might be realigning your leadership team, exploring new ways of working, or working to rebuild trust and cohesion — whether in the wake of a challenging period or right in the midst of it. If that’s the case, we’d love to start the conversation.

    "company_description": "Welcome to the Crowell School of Business where we provide a distinctive approach to business leadership. We call it Business as Ministry. Why is this important? Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact. At Crowell, business education is designed so you learn and put into practice career-relevant business skills while engaging your faith and launching your career. We invite you to learn more about our School and programs by following us on LinkedIn and going to our web page. Or even better: come by and visit us some time!",

    "summary": "You know how hard it is to buy fresh food at reasonable prices year-round that hasn’t travelled thousands of miles and arrived at the grocery store still “green”? Nearly 19 million people in the US live in “food deserts”, meaning they don’t live near a grocery store. It’s not just lower-income folks that struggle. Big cities like LA and NY and Chicago have trouble providing fresh food to its citizens. I work with architects, engineers, farmers, and city planners to create buildings that come alive and are a source of food for the people that live there. There tends to be a struggle between architects, engineers, and city planners to develop indoor farms that meet strict building codes, are architecturally attractive, and can grow the foods that people want to eat. Growing thousands of plants indoors with these building restrictions quickly complicate the project. The people that are involved in these projects have specialized knowledge, like a musician in a symphony. They are experts at their instrument and look to the Conductor to provide guidance on when and how to play so that the music is played beautifully for the audience. I’m like the conductor when it comes to these big projects. I can “see” how, when, and where, the players need to bring their specialized knowledge to create the building that grows the food desired by the audience (in this case, the people that live in the city). Conductors know when certain instrument need to play louder, softer, and not at all. As the conductor, I know when to engage the engineers, architects, farmers, city planners and funders. When people work with me, they know they are an integral part of the team and how their role fits into production. More important, they can focus on bringing their specialized skills and talents to the project, free from the stresses of micromanaging components that don’t excite them or detract from what they love working on. What kind of food sustainability projects are you trying to build? I'd love to listen and see how I can support your efforts.",

    "summary": "• What is the meaning of life? • You are living life as if what is its meaning? • Do you know why you are here and for what purpose? • How do you measure your life? • Are you satisfied with the quality of your life? It all started with a paradox. Years ago, I went through a difficult period asking myself precisely the questions above. Searching for answers, I discovered that others shared my concerns. As I described it in my first book, I faced a paradox: \"Humanity does not suffer from a lack of answers; rather, it suffers despite the answers being available.\" This paradox became the central quest that led to the start of a new school of psychology: meaningful purpose. Fortunately, I discovered the answers to these existential questions, solved the paradox, and built a practice to help people get the necessary remedies. The point? You, too, can deal with your own paradoxes and benefit by finding the answers to these existential questions. So, if you have big plans and have been giving your all … YET you are struggling with any of the following … • Resistance to your efforts to make a positive difference at work and in social settings. • Lack of Support preventing you from achieving your professional goals and life dreams. • Discouragement from trying to bring to life relationships that should thrive but don't. • Frustration that your contributions are not being acknowledged and appreciated. • Disappointment with people who are indifferent and unresponsive to your contributions, aspirations, and talent. • Exhaustion from investing in long hours at work for little to no appreciation. • Disappointed that your life lacks meaning and direction. But there is hope! The Boston Institute for Meaningful Purpose has something to end the pain. It is called \"Meaning Analysis and Improvement.\" When you harness the \"Meaning Analysis and Improvement\" method, you will … • Deepen your self-understanding and of your surroundings. • Build your self-confidence. • Discover your strengths and confront your weaknesses courageously for self-improvement. • Discern what other's agendas and their motives are. • Know the \"real\" root cause of a problem or situation. • Understand what your options are and how to select the most promising one.

Our goal is to create unique physical and digital products that help grownups connect with their kids. In 2023, we developed Implement and installed an institution-scale prototype at a childcare facility in McKeesport, PA. We utilized plastic 3D printing manufacturing for low-cost, rapid, on-demand production of parts that can be made anywhere in the world. In 2021, we learned about Picky Eaters, a line of BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and CPSC-certified food picks for children. We fell in love with the characters and the idea of providing a tool for making part of parenting a little bit easier. In May 2024, when we began developing a business plan for Implement, Real Kids International acquired Picky Eaters to expand our product line. The Picky Eaters characters are now being developed into cartoons, affectionately called “Real Kids,” which will live in a digital universe and help spread our message of connection and acceptance. The Real Kids characters will also be developed into physical and digital products, forming a bridge between our two major product lines, Picky Eaters and Implement. At the heart of Real Kids International is a deep commitment to inclusion and empowerment. Through our products, community initiatives, and advocacy efforts, we are working toward a world where neurodivergent children are celebrated for who they are, where they feel valued and included, and where every caregiver feels supported on their journey.",

    "summary": "I’m Keith Liscio, the Founder and President of Excelsior Franchise Center. My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners. If you’re serious about being in business, I can find one that will fit your needs. If you’d like to learn more, schedule some time on my calendar and I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have. Just click here: https://meetings.hubspot.com/keith-liscio",

If your pipeline is stalling, your sales cycles are dragging, or your “growth plan” still relies on the founder’s Rolodex, the problem isn’t your team. It’s your system. Or lack of one. Most early-stage tech companies hit a plateau because they confuse motion with momentum. - They generate leads... but not sales conversations. - They hire reps... before fixing the funnel. - They enter the US market... with messaging that doesn’t land. Here’s what most teams miss: “You cannot succeed in your market without an intimate understanding of your ICP and why they’ll write you a check.” To catch the right fish, you need to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right bait. I teach you how. I’ve worked with over 50+ B2B SaaS and tech-enabled service companies, especially those in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated markets — to help them: - Multiply pipeline by 2–3× - Cut sales cycles in half - Reduce CAC by 30–50% - Build outbound systems that actually generate sales conversations - Create repeatable sales processes that don’t rely on heroics And I do it in a phased, capital-efficient way: Step 1 — ICP Sprint: Define and validate your highest-fit buyer segments, key decision makers, and messaging that resonates. Step 2 — Outreach Engine Build: Stand up a multichannel system (LinkedIn + email + content) that generates real conversations in less than 90 days. Step 3 — Revenue Ops Process: Establish a repeatable sales process, CRM, reporting, and enablement to convert conversations into revenue. Step 4 — Advisory: Once traction is proven, I step in to drive strategy, coach the team, and scale execution. 📥 Want to see how this plays out in the real world?

    "summary": "A while back, I found myself at a crossroads.I wanted my next role to check three key boxes:✔ Work with a leader I respected (or better yet, was inspired by)✔ Be part of a company whose mission excited me✔ Fit into a culture where people actually thrive. Then I realized – finding all three was like looking for a needle in a wheat field.So, I stopped looking and started reflecting. What I really love—the work that fires me up—is helping leaders and teams find their power and perform at their potential. Across my career, whether I was turning around a struggling nonprofit, helping to scale a cybersecurity firm, working on the Olympics, or running my own business, I kept seeing the same issue:➡️ Companies often put good people in leadership roles without the right training or support.➡️ Those leaders struggle, which leads to frustration, turnover, and wasted potential.➡️ The business suffers, and no one wins. But when companies get it right—when they develop strong leaders, put people in roles that fit their strengths, and create a culture where teams perform. That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees. I do this through leadership coaching, advisory, and fractional executive support, powered by data-driven tools like leadership diagnostics, psychometric assessments, and culture analytics. Leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about unlocking potential. When you get that right, performance, retention, and engagement follow naturally. Curious where to start? If you’re wondering whether your leadership team is aligned or your culture is working for—or against—you, try my quick Leadership Alignment Diagnostic (no cost). It’s a short series of questions that reveals where your biggest opportunities lie.👉 Book a complimentary 20-minute call, or message me “FindMyMana” to start the diagnostic.",

    "summary": "What if you had a client acquisition system that consistently attracted, nurtured, and converted leads—without relying on referrals—allowing you to focus entirely on coaching? Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business. With over 25 years of experience in digital marketing, including being the director of global web and eCommerce at a Financial Times Top 10 organization, I’ve seen how smart marketing transforms organizations and how small businesses struggle with marketing and business growth. I co-founded Chart Room Creative, Compass OS, and Wyndi AI to help small businesses amplify their impact without the stress of client acquisition. Ready to make this vision a reality?

We combine nervous-system-aware leadership, frequency-first strategy, and a practical method called Harmonic Design™ to help your team operate with more clarity, better decisions, and results that hold. This isn’t fluff. And it’s not hustle. It’s the future of leadership — and it starts in the body. ✨ Clarity First. Strategy Second. Results That Last™.

    "summary": "Most capable leaders don’t struggle because they lack skill. They struggle because the same leadership capabilities that earned promotion stop scaling as complexity increases. Execution slows, not from effort, but from Leadership Operating System mismatch. As organizations grow, priorities shift faster, decisions become interdependent, and coordination costs rise. Strong leaders work harder, but results don’t compound the way they used to. This is rarely a performance issue. It’s a Leadership Operating System issue. I work with leaders and executive teams to identify where leadership systems built for more stable conditions are breaking under complexity and how to evolve them so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience. My work focuses on upgrading how leaders think, decide, and operate together when scale, uncertainty, and pressure increase. Leadership Operating System Upgrades I Focus On • Escaping the Expert Trap Shifting from individual problem-solving to system-level leadership and decision architecture • Strategic Alignment Architecture Reducing decision latency and coordination friction across functions, teams, and stakeholders • Business Value Translation Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not burnout or heroics Background I bring 20+ years of experience working across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, supporting leadership and organizational reinvention in complex, global environments.

Our founder’s journey started during her recovery when she discovered a passion for the human side of performance. This led her to journalism, covering the inner workings of Major League Baseball player development for NPR. Being on the ground gave Kim a deep understanding of the complexity, ambiguity and risk that leaders and staff in pro sports and entertainment face every day. Now, we serve as the long-term strategic partner to talent at organizations in the most demanding industries, helping them build the personal and team resiliency to create winning leadership and cultures. We’ve delivered over 4,500 sessions to employees at top companies like Google, American Express and Warner Bros. Discovery.

She's a strategic partner. She has a unique ability to help you peel back the layers of complex, multi-faceted challenges until you find the core issue. I went into our work feeling overwhelmed and left with a profound sense of clarity and peace. She doesn't just help you solve problems.

But I had to make a living, so I founded a marketing agency. I worked with B2B service businesses, and promised them what everyone does. More marketing means: - More leads - More clients - More revenue Long story short, that didn't happen. I wasn't getting results because my approach was wrong. I noticed: Like most businesses, when B2B service firms want more clients, they invest in marketing. They chase cold leads, lose a ton of money, and wonder why nothing's working. So rather than being yet another run-of-the-mill marketing agency, I pivoted. Now, I build infrastructure to get more referrals. Why? It's the cheapest, fastest, and most effective way for a B2B service firm to grow. WHAT I BUILD: Referable Brand → Positioning and messaging so clients know exactly who to refer to you Validation-Ready Digital Presence → Website and LinkedIn optimized for referral confidence, not SEO traffic Relationship CRM → Automated touchpoints that keep your network warm and generate systematic referrals WHO THIS IS FOR: Established B2B service firms ($500K-$5M) with 20+ client relationships but no system to leverage them. Consulting firms, agencies, coaches. WHY REFERRALS ARE BETTER: - They convert 71% higher than paid leads - They close 69% faster - Retention rates are 37% higher You might worry about being dependent on referrals. Odds are, you're not dependent ENOUGH. I've built infrastructure for 20+ clients in the past year—creative agencies, solo consultants, coaches, EOS implementers, even a catering company.

Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you. Let’s build something that lasts.",

    "summary": "I’ve always believed that every difference—whether in perspective, background, or approach—holds the potential for connection and transformation. That belief has shaped my two-decade journey as a leadership consultant, certified coach, and intercultural expert. Along the way, I’ve had the privilege of partnering with organizations to foster inclusive, collaborative, and high-performing cultures that drive engagement, innovation, and sustainable success. My career is rooted in a simple yet powerful philosophy: resolving differences leads to redefining leadership. From navigating complex organizational challenges to coaching executives, my work is guided by a structured process I call the Reconciliation Method™. This approach bridges diverse perspectives into cohesive strategies, delivering solutions that are not only actionable but authentically aligned with an organization’s values. Whether I’m facilitating cultural audits, optimizing team dynamics, or coaching leaders to connect their values with their actions, I aim to help organizations thrive by putting people at the heart of their success. Over the years, I’ve led the design and global expansion of DEIB strategies, cultivated growth-oriented, human-centered cultures, and created frameworks for alignment that endure. My process is both data-driven and deeply empathetic, ensuring every recommendation is practical, sustainable, and meaningful. I specialize in leadership development, organizational alignment, and creating cultural transformation that sticks. When I’m not immersed in bridging gaps and aligning leadership values, you’ll often find me exploring new cities, indulging in the rich history and local cuisine that each place has to offer. As a firm believer in the power of connection, I also cherish moments spent with friends and family—whether at a lively dinner table or a serene outdoor retreat. My mission is clear: to help leaders and teams unlock their full potential, fostering cultures where collaboration isn’t just a goal—it’s the standard. Ready to take the next step in building alignment and creating a thriving culture? Let’s connect and explore how we can turn differences into opportunities for transformation and success.",

WHY MY EXPERIENCE MATTERS TO YOUR BUSINESS: I spent my career leading marketing, sales, and business development for well-known consumer brands and manufacturing firms. While my expertise began in consumer-driven industries, the principles of growth, positioning, and strategy apply universally and are just as critical for professional service firms as they are for consumer brands. Professional service firms struggle with differentiation, client acquisition, and scaling.

My expertise blends both, helping professional service firms apply consumer-driven insights to win more business while guiding consumer brands to develop lasting market impact. HOW I HELP: ✔ Growth Strategy & Positioning – Establishing a compelling market position that drives demand and revenue. ✔ Leadership & Team Optimization – Helping owners develop leadership skills, structure strong teams, and build a results-driven culture. ✔ Sales & Marketing Acceleration – Driving lead generation, conversion, and long-term customer engagement. ✔ Business Efficiency & Financial Strategy – Identifying key operational efficiencies to improve profitability and scale effectively. ✔ Exit & Transition Planning – Preparing businesses for leadership transitions, mergers, or sales to maximize value. REAL RESULTS, REAL IMPACT: ✅ Transformed professional service firms by refining messaging, improving operations, and increasing client acquisition. ✅ Led go-to-market strategies that drove multimillion-dollar growth for national and global consumer brands. ✅ Revitalized declining industries through strategic branding and marketing that increased market share and profitability. ✅ Helped business owners scale and exit by positioning their companies for sustainable growth and maximum valuation.

I help leaders and organizations create a culture of inclusion and psychological safety where innovation thrives. My master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling informs my holistic, research-backed coaching framework. Together, we explore new perspectives and identify solutions for growth and success as well as health and well-being. In 1998, I moved from my native Finland to New York City. I was the first in my family to earn a college degree and, like many others, I craved the energy, inspiration, and diversity of life in NYC. I held career services and HR & development roles before founding my independent coaching practice. My expertise lies in international and highly-demanding professional contexts—since founding my practice, my work has taken me to Helsinki, Rome, Bangkok, and Bonn and I’ve worked with leaders based across six continents. Sisu—the Finnish concept of resilience—and my own personal experiences as an immigrant have deeply influenced my coaching philosophy. My approach to coaching is built upon a core belief in our human capacity to learn and grow, to succeed through challenges, and live and lead with purpose. Alongside my coaching practice, I am an experienced senior non-profit founder and board leader. I have founded, led, and developed several global and local non-profit community organizations over the past 30 years. After I moved to NYC, I founded two non-profit organizations with and for Nordic women. I have served as vice-president for a global non-profit FIGT.org, and the local Finnish American Chamber of Commerce in NYC. I led the Chatham High School Marching Band Club, a registered 501c3, as President for several years. As a leader, I am driven by my values to make a difference by strengthening communities through engagement. In all my leadership experiences, I have improved the performance and structure of the board—I am a skilled organizer known for getting things done. I lead with a strong vision and clear goals while building engagement and motivation through communication and relationship building.

He earned his doctoral degree from the Graduate Psychology program at Azusa Pacific University. Their theoretical emphasis on Systems theory and unique holistic integration philosophy helped him to become very effective in conceptualizing and implementing strategic growth plans for individuals, families, and corporations. Dr. Andy uniquely emphasizes a positive psychology approach that utilizes established individual, familial, and organizational strengths rather than underscoring what may be pathological or dysfunctional. In blending this approach with a systems theoretical model, existential psychology, and solution-focused strategies, he's empowered to provide a transformative brand of coaching and consulting. Throughout his career, he’s contributed a significant and meaningful role as a consultant for multiple faith-based organizations - where he specializes in empowering his clients to discover and establish their True North identity, purpose, and community - and then integrate radically resilient principles, practices, and strategies - that enable his clients to consistently achieve their biggest goals and actualize their greatest potential. Dr. Andy has made a considerable impact working as a performance coach for high performing executives, elite athletes, and organizations throughout Southern California - and beyond (his online coaching curriculum has been effectively utilized and taught throughout the US - and even in select European countries). Dr. Andy has developed a thriving private practice in the renowned Newport Beach area, and he offers custom private workshops, corporate training programs, he is a highly sought after speaker and podcast guest, and he continues to offer concierge style coaching services (although - openings with Dr. Andy are rare to come by - so, if you are interested in working with him one on one - you should get on his waiting list ASAP!).",

It started from the time I was a kid, when I developed a fascination with downtowns - the interesting collections of buildings right next to each other with so many diverse activities going on inside them. When I began to see my downtown emptying out, like so many others, I knew I wanted to be a part of saving it, rebuilding it, and bringing it back to life. At first I took that literally - going to school to study architecture and engineering to revitalize and repurpose historic buildings. Later, I realized that I could have an additional impact by being a part of getting new business energy into those spaces for revitalization and growth. Fast forward to today, I have a two-pronged approach to support business: guiding companies as they come into existence, and also advising business how to operate efficiently so they stay in existence. From Main Street businesses to Fortune 500 corporations, and from incubators/accelerators to economic development agencies, my clients have benefited from interacting with me and my teams for over a decade. In addition to a substantial library of operations know-how, key tools in my leadership toolbox are: actively listening to constituents and 360-degree awareness of everyone in the ecosystem; circumspection while clearly seeing all points of view; and optimizing a strategic win-win outcome that can be operationally executed by a balance of guidance and inclusion of all stakeholders.

    "summary": "Hi, I’m Carlamay Sheremata. I’m a retired police officer, keynote speaker, award-winning author, and family conflict resolution specialist—but more than that, I’m a bridge-builder. Between systems and people. Between leaders and their teams. Between families and the youth they love. After 21 years in law enforcement—including 8.5 years as a School Resource Officer—I’ve seen what happens when people lose connection. I’ve watched families fracture, leaders burn out, teams implode, and kids fall through the cracks. Not because people didn’t care—but because they didn’t know how to lead through the hard stuff. That’s why I created the CALM Leadership Method™—a trust-centered, emotionally intelligent approach to leadership that works in real life. Under pressure. In crisis. In the moments that matter most. I now help corporate teams, educators, frontline professionals, and families lead with connection, rebuild trust where it’s been lost, and communicate clearly when it counts most—at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Whether I’m on stage speaking to executives, equipping frontline teams, or sitting across from a family in conflict, I bring the same message: Connection heals what correction can’t. And if we don’t fix the disconnection, we lose the people who need us most. I’m also the author of the award-winning book Youth Truth: Engaging in Conversations That Can Change Lives—a raw, practical guide that equips parents, educators, and mentors to connect with today’s youth on the tough topics that matter most. It’s not just a book—it’s a bridge between generations, emotions, and relationships. Through real stories, bold truths, and actionable tools, I teach people how to lead with clarity, courage, and compassion—without burning out or checking out. Because when we get connection right, everything changes.

In Youth Truth, you will discover how to approach the difficult topics that need to be talked about with your kids or students. You can do it with empathy and support.

From the haunting shadows of suicide to the insidious presence of bullying to the silent struggles of eating disorders and the desperate yearning just to be seen–this narrative bares it all. It is a powerful testament to the resilience, strength, and untold stories of a generation yearning for understanding and compassion.

    "company_description": "Leaders in executive search and talent acquisition spend their days advising others, managing expectations, navigating pressure, and holding complex human dynamics. They are expected to be decisive, composed, and constantly available, often while absorbing stress from clients, candidates, partners, and teams. The challenge is not a lack of capability. It is the accumulation. The cost shows up as blurred priorities, reactive decision-making, leadership fatigue, and the quiet sense that there is no place to put the weight you are carrying. Leadership in talent and search can feel grounded, clear, and sustainable without losing edge, credibility, or performance. When we work together, leaders gain clearer judgment under pressure, greater confidence navigating client, candidate, and internal dynamics, and practical tools to manage complexity without constant reactivity. The result is steadiness that carries into teams, clients, and decisions. This work supports leaders who are already strong and want to lead with greater clarity, presence, and meaningful connection, particularly in complex, high-pressure environments. I have spent my career in executive search and talent acquisition. I understand the pace, the pressure, and the unspoken expectations that shape this work. My coaching blends leadership experience, talent expertise, and a structured, human-centered approach for leaders who do not need theory. They need clarity. I bring over two decades of experience working alongside senior leaders in executive search, recruiting, and people-driven organizations, including scaling and leading global search operations for a PE-backed talent advisory firm through organic and M&A growth. If this resonates with you or your team, I invite you to schedule a confidential conversation to explore whether coaching support would be useful right now.",
