## Step 4: Identify the Real Bottleneck

Which stage has the biggest drop-off?

- [ ] Accept rate (target: 25-35%) → Currently: 35.5% ✓
- [ ] Reply rate (target: 15-25% qualified) → Currently: ____%
- [ ] Your response rate (target: 100% within 24hrs) → Currently: ____%

## Step 5: Questions for Mentor

1. Is my ICP attracting the wrong people? (lots of pitches/wrong fit)
2. Is my first message too vague? (lots of "not interested")
3. What's killing momentum? (slow response time)
4. Should I change targeting or messaging first?
