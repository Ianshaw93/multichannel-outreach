That’s where I come in—with strategy, structure, and the FROST Framework. I’m the co-founder of yorCMO, the first decentralized leadership franchise for fractional CMOs. And now, I’m scaling FractionalPros.com, a platform that connects SMBs with vetted fractional leaders—and helps those leaders find visibility, leads, and community through niche-driven peer pods. I believe in decentralized teams, strategic clarity, and the idea that every expert deserves a business model that works for them, not just because of them. I’ve had a non-linear career and life. I’ve: - Started a lawn care service in high school and sold the business before college - Studied and worked in chemical engineering - Founded 4 companies: from mortgage financing to media to data haptics tech - Published and written a book on media habits - Taught Entrepreneurship to university students - Created a documentary film on the seasons of entrepreneurship - Launched a community for fractional pros I spent years attempting to reconcile my wildly diverse experiences, let alone trying to explain them to those around me. Eventually, I realized that my decentralized nature was an asset: I could help other entrepreneurs engineer non-traditional, weird, unexpected and creative ideas into their businesses.

Since 2016, we’ve built a growing team of fractional CMOs, exclusively limited to those with decades of experience and proven leadership in various industries. As part of the yorCMO proven process, your CMO becomes a fiduciary partner, building your customized strategy and executing it in a way that drives up sales, without wasting any more of your time or money.

That’s why when you partner with us, we’re more than a consultant. We’re on your team‒ but for a fraction of the cost of adding on another full-time employee. Our results-driven fractional CMO model is designed to allow us to integrate with your existing team so that you get the customized solutions, C-Level expertise, and proven process you need.

And leadership models built on control and hierarchy are breaking down. I provide architecture that makes teams self-managing for Fractionals, Business Owners, Consultants and Coaches. Leaders and HR partners tell me the same thing: “We know collaboration matters—but we can’t measure it, sustain it, or scale it.” That’s where the TIGERS® 6 Principles System comes in. It equips leaders and HR partners to turn AI-driven flattening into a human advantage through measurable trust, collaboration, and engagement. For more than 30 years, I’ve helped organizations—from Fortune 500s to nonprofits—create high-trust, self-aligning cultures that thrive in complexity. The TIGERS System builds six measurable principles that drive collaboration: Trust | Interdependence | Genuineness | Empathy | Risk Resolution | Success. These aren’t soft skills. They’re behavioral metrics that leaders can observe, measure, and scale. That’s why we license this framework to coaches, consultants, and HR partners who want to deliver sustainable, people-centered transformation that makes work easier not harder. When trust becomes measurable, transformation becomes unstoppable.

We design and implement connected GTM infrastructure across outbound, inbound, RevOps, content, and AI execution. Instead of running isolated campaigns, we focus on building repeatable systems that create consistent pipeline and momentum over time. Our work is centered around six core systems, deployed based on where growth breaks down. These include AI powered outbound engines, account based intent systems, inbound flow orchestration, CRM activation, content engagement systems, and AI agent orchestration for faster and more consistent execution. Each system is designed to work together as one revenue motion, ensuring that signals are captured, data is usable, and opportunities move forward instead of getting lost. Kinetyca was founded on the belief that revenue becomes predictable when go to market efforts are structured as systems rather than tactics. We combine strategy, tooling, and hands on implementation to help teams move from fragmented execution to clarity and control. We work with B2B startups, scale ups, and revenue teams who want to own their GTM motion, not rely on constant experimentation or manual effort. Our engagements are built around focused 90 day motions. We diagnose what is missing or broken, build and activate only what is needed, and optimize based on real market feedback. What we build is fully transparent, documented, and owned by our clients.",

My clients know that \"soft skills\" are, in fact, hard. They come to us because they want to develop their ACE-Q (=AQ+CQ+EQ). Every organization that ignores the Culture Gap ends up paying for it: through lost revenue, disengaged talent, failed synergies, and missed opportunity. As a leader in a global company you have a choice: Talk to a cross-cultural expert now, or call them when the damage is done. Either way, you'll need to address culture… because it always shows up. And when it does, it won’t care about your org chart or your P&L. It will simply do what it does: shape behavior, accelerate alignment, or erode value.

    "summary": "Over the years, I’ve learned that the decisions we make as leaders ripple far beyond the boardroom. They shape careers, cultures, and communities... and, perhaps most importantly, they set an example for the people watching us most closely — at work, and at home. I’ve worn many hats: CEO, operating executive, advisor, dealmaker, coach, and podcast host. I’ve led sales from $400 million to over $1 billion in an organic growth cycle, delivered 4x growth in six years, navigated more than a dozen acquisitions, and opened new markets. I’ve worked in public companies, private equity-backed businesses, and family-owned enterprises in the middle of steep growth curves. The scale changes, but the through-line is always the same: connect great people, align them around a shared purpose, and give them the space to do their best work. That belief fuels my work at LEAD3R and as host of The Future of Teamwork Podcast, where I’ve interviewed more than 150 leaders from every corner of the working world. Each conversation is a masterclass in leadership - part learning, part teaching, always a reminder that kindness and clarity are not mutually exclusive in high performance. These dialogues sharpen my own leadership style, helping me find new ways to guide teams that are both values-driven and results-focused. I’m endlessly fascinated by the changing shape of tomorrow’s workplace - how technology, community, and business can intersect to tackle big challenges like diversity and inclusion, skills transfer, innovation, and disruption. It’s a space where curiosity is an asset, and collaboration is both art and science. At this point in my career, I know two things for certain: great teams don’t happen by accident, and leadership is a privilege that comes with a responsibility to use it well. If you’re as interested in building purposeful teams and unlocking the potential of people as I am, I’d be glad to connect.",

    "summary": "If you are a CEO, entrepreneur or business owner pursuing mergers or acquisitions as part of your growth strategy, let’s talk. There’s a reason CEO's call me an \"M&A Whisperer\". The title comes from my work advising leaders and organizations on the \"unexpected people challenges\" of Mergers & Acquisitions. The challenges that can doom a deal but which rarely get covered in M&A preparedness training. I've been on all sides of the deal equation and show leaders what it takes to lead people through change and uncertainty. My leadership lessons came as an international C-Suite executive leading teams through three separate multibillion-dollar deals. I learned firsthand that M&A growth strategies suffer when leaders haven’t been prepared to guide their teams through the emotional roller-coaster that can occur post-deal. No wonder people struggle to pivot and adapt as quickly as management expects. These insights and lessons were captured in my best-selling M&A business book, \"NOW WHAT? A Survivor’s Guide for Thriving Through Mergers & Acquisitions\" which serves as a playbook for executives and handbook for frontline leaders balancing their day job with post-deal integration work. My M&A consultancy, Day1 Ready was founded on the premise that M is for Mindset and A is for Agile. Through one-day workshops and keynotes, I’ve prepared hundreds of CEOs, executives and middle managers to recognize that success in M&A is not solely achieved by following static playbooks; success comes from having an adaptive mindset and an agile approach. Speaking on human capital strategies that drive M&A success, I’ve guest lectured at the University of Chicago/Booth School of Business, Northwestern, and Thunderbird School of Global Management. I write a business leadership column for Forbes and contribute to Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Inc. Honored as Entrepreneur of the Year by Northshore Women in Business in 2019, I was recently ranked the #1 M&A Leadership Consultant by Leadership Research Institute and nominated to Thinkers50 2024 Radar list of future management thinkers to watch.

Most 'succession advisors' are former brokers who've never written a check. I've written millions in checks. ✅ Bought businesses with my own money and advised buyers and sellers in over $250 million worth of small business deals. ✅ Learned how to systematize and grow businesses to not depend on their owners to operate (on my own dime!) ✅ Sold businesses to strategic buyers ✅ Structured management buyouts that actually worked ✅ Helped owners pass to family without destroying relationships ✅ Come from a real-world, dirty fingernails, operational background, not a consultant who only knows spreadsheets. I've sat in every chair at the closing table. That's the difference. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH: Your business is probably unsellable right now. - You're irreplaceable (buyers run from this) - Your financials tell three different stories - Your team would quit if you left tomorrow - You have no idea what you're actually worth But here's what most owners don't know: The changes that make your business sellable also make it more profitable TODAY. That's why smart owners start succession preparation years before they need it. Not to sell. But to have the OPTION to sell. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WHERE ARE YOU? 🔴 TRAPPED: \"I can't take a real vacation without chaos\" → We build systems so the business runs without you 🟡 GROWING: \"I need to scale but organic growth is too slow\" → We acquire competitors or expand strategically 🟢 PREPARING: \"I want options but don't know where to start\" → We create your succession roadmap (family, management, or sale) ⚪ READY: \"It's time. Get me the best outcome possible\" → We run a process that adds 30-50% to your value ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ THE BOTTOM LINE: I don't push anyone toward a sale. That's what brokers do. I help you build a business with options: - Option to run it forever (profitably) - Option to pass to family (smoothly) - Option to sell to management / employees (fairly) - Option to sell to a strategic (lucratively) No options = prison.

    "summary": "I help CEOs and executives move from being “operators who get things done” to being “leaders who create advantage and lasting impact.” Who are you? Mid-level and senior executives who’ve been told they “need to be more strategic.” Leaders who are strong operators but struggle to make the shift into strategic roles. Organizations that want their managers at all levels to think and act more strategically, not just execute. New CEOs and executives inheriting entrenched strategies who need to reshape thinking across their teams. 2. What keeps you up at night? Fear of being seen as “not strategic enough” and getting sidelined or even laid off. Overloaded agendas where everything feels urgent but little feels truly strategic. Frustration with plans that don’t move the organization forward—lots of initiatives, little impact. The weight of uncertainty and complexity—noise, turbulence, and competing priorities. Worry about losing influence, missing opportunities, or being blindsided by disruption. 3. What have you tried? Reading strategy books or attending planning-heavy courses that explain what strategy is but not how to be strategic. Creating long lists of initiatives and cascading them down through the org chart—only to produce confusion and traffic jams. Traditional “strategic planning” that focuses on budgets and targets instead of shaping thinking and decisions. Leaning on OKRs or similar tools that masquerade as strategy but don’t shift behavior or perspective. 4. The transformation you need? To be recognized as true strategic thinkers—not just operators who execute. To shift from reactive, tactical fire-fighting to enactive, purpose-driven leadership. To see complexity more clearly, prioritize effectively, and focus on leverage points for real impact. To gain influence in their organizations by connecting their work directly to strategy. To build confidence that they can navigate uncertainty and shape the future rather than just respond to it.

    "connections": "4952",
    "summary": "Most organizations are built to break under pressure. As complexity grows, roles blur. Trust thins. Decisions stall. Culture becomes a slogan instead of a system. Performance starts to feel like politics. Morale tanks. That’s not a motivation problem. It’s a systems failure. And you can’t fix systems with hype, pulse surveys, or another off-site. You need infrastructure—the kind that scales clarity, trust, and execution without burning your team out. That’s where I come in. I’m a strategic advisor and fractional Chief People Officer. I partner with CEOs and executive teams to build the people infrastructure that makes leadership sustainable—and performance inevitable. What that looks like: ▪️ Executive onboarding that builds trust & traction—not just orientation ▪️ Leadership team development that shifts behavior—not alignment theater ▪️ Culture operating systems that turn values into decisions—not wall art ▪️ Performance architecture that actually gets used—not another abandoned framework I’m typically brought in when: ▪️ Culture and leadership aren’t keeping pace with complexity—showing up in turnover, missed goals, or decision paralysis ▪️ Feedback and performance systems feel fragile or performative ▪️ Legacy habits are blocking next-level execution ▪️ A new exec hire or strategic shift needs to land fast and lead hard My edge? I learned to build systems where failure wasn’t an option. I spent over a decade as a teacher, principal, and system-level education leader—environments where broken systems have immediate consequences. That’s where I learned to design for equity, lead through complexity, and build trust in high-stakes conditions. Now I bring that same pressure-tested lens to companies that can’t afford to get people systems wrong. Recent impact: → Helped a global nonprofit build shared language and capacity → Rebuilt performance management from form-filling to real growth conversations → Guided managing directors through M&A transition at a newly PE-backed firm → Built strategic roadmap that expanded leadership team impact for a school head Here’s what I know: You don’t fix culture with charisma. You don’t fix performance with perks. You fix them with infrastructure—clear roles, fair processes, and systems that scale trust. When people systems are designed with intention, change doesn’t just happen. It sticks. And it spreads. 👉 https://calendly.com/lfriscia/20-minute-discovery-call Want more thinking like this?

Franca Consulting helps organizations move from scrappy to sustainable by building leadership and talent infrastructure that increases clarity, capacity, and execution — without burning people out. We partner with CEOs, executive teams, and senior leaders in social enterprise, nonprofits, schools, and purpose-led organizations to strengthen the systems that make leadership work: how decisions get made, how roles are defined, how feedback and learning happen, and how change actually lands. Our work is grounded in a simple belief: most leadership challenges aren’t about effort or commitment — they’re about infrastructure. How We Work We focus on practical, system-level support that leaders can use immediately, including: -Leadership Infrastructure Diagnostics to surface what’s creating drag and where to focus first -Design & Strategy Sprints to translate priorities into executable plans -Facilitation & Leadership Alignment to build shared language, habits, and decision clarity This is not cookie-cutter solutions or one-off training. It’s infrastructure-building work designed to support both performance and people. When leadership systems are clear and well-designed, leaders don’t have to rely on heroics — and teams can do their best work sustainably.",

    "summary": "WHAT I DO: For more than 35 years and over 600 engagements, I have rapidly helped companies with revenue $5MM to $50MM fix their cash flow and plan cash flow and operations changes for future profitability. Even small businesses can be complex. I help owners and managers understand the cash flow impact of their decisions and actions to ensure optimal operations that lead to good cash flow. In that effort, not only have I been a consultant (now CTP), I have been named a Chapter 11 Trustee, Federal and State Receiver and Assignee. HOW I DO IT: The Newpoint team and I help you create cash flow forecasts and budgets using Cash Flow Launcher™. We teach owners and managers how to manage cash on their own, but we also deploy our proprietary diagnostic tool (TAME™) to help with the changes you need to make to ensure your business becomes stronger. Access to TAME™ trained professionals makes sure you are seeing what you need to make the right decisions for your business. WHY IT WORKS: When you partner with Newpoint, you get the most efficient, effective, and affordable turnaround help. Our ROI is a verified 2700% for owners and stakeholders. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: Our Cash Flow Coach™ program and our other services are provided on a fixed-fee/fixed-time basis, so you know what it is going to cost beforehand. The tools are designed for rapid deployment, so you can get answers fast (120 Days+)– because that is what you need. Our proprietary TAME™ company diagnostic tool with 120 questions and industry best-in-class benchmarking takes the emotions out of the introspection about your business and is designed for rapid deployment – again, because that is what you need. These tools have been tested with hundreds of companies like yours. Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,620,000,000 in debt and saved 14,731 jobs.

When you struggle with cash flow, it is often due to a lack of understanding about how your business decisions are impacting cash or you have a sense you have tried everything. Frustration leads to doubt and a business suffers as a result. Our clients are the size companies that hire the majority of people and pay most of the taxes in this country. However, these companies do not have consistent access to professional cash flow management that would help them in a time of need. That is where Newpoint comes in. CASE STUDY: Often companies are sent to us when they are in significant trouble. Our job is to move quickly to give them visibility to the issues and come up with viable solutions. We have worked with hundreds of companies that faced game changing decisions, like one mid-west based machine shop. They had been around for years, but since economic turmoil and some personal matters came up, they had not been able to turn a profit. Their lender was fatigued, but not totally ready to give up. We were able to work with management over a two week period of time, put together a Cash Flow Launcher™ tool that showed where quick changes would solve the immediate issues. The result - their lender stuck with them. TAME™ helped management see where some longer term changes would make them stronger. The rapid deployment of Newpoint's Proprietary Cash Flow Launcher coupled with professional insight from TAME™ gave the company the tools to see in days what they had not been able to clear up for several years. STATISTICS: Since founding Newpoint in 2013, CFL™ and TAME™ have been able to help financiers recover $1,355,000,000 in debt and saved 13,414 jobs. WHAT I DO: cash flow coaching, turnaround consulting, turnaround management, change company outcomes, restructure debt, refinance distressed companies, sell distressed companies, TAME™, Cash Flow Launcher™, free cash flow model.",

    "summary": "I’m the HR partner companies call when they need more than a placeholder—they need a builder, an evaluator, and a trusted advisor. Throughout my career, I’ve been the first HR executive at organizations navigating growth, change, or transition—brought in to assess what exists, identify what’s missing, and design people strategies that scale. I don’t need an existing playbook. I evaluate, reimagine, and implement systems that align culture with growth and ensure people feel valued, supported, and seen. From BrightView to MVAH Partners, Forta, and Jones Lake Management, I’ve helped organizations shift from reactive to strategic by building HR functions from the ground up. My work spans private equity-backed, founder-led, startup, and scale-up companies—typically under 5,000 employees—across industries like behavioral health, ABA therapy, affordable housing, manufacturing, and emergency veterinary care. Through my firm, People Solutions Group, I advise CEOs, founders, and investors on how to align people strategy with business goals—whether they’re navigating a merger, restructuring, or preparing to scale. I also serve as faculty with the Human Capital Institute, where I facilitate programs in Strategic HR Business Partnership, Strategic Talent Acquisition, Workforce Planning, Change Management, and People Analytics—helping HR and business leaders grow their capability, confidence, and influence. Through my podcast, Amplify Your Signal, I spotlight professionals in transition and elevate the human side of work. Not sure where to start with your people strategy, team evaluation, or how to scale without losing culture? That’s where I come in. Feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to connect and talk through what you’re navigating.",

    "summary": "I work with smart, ambitious professionals and the organizations they lead — helping teams and leaders get unstuck, aligned, and ready to move when things feel complex or high-stakes. I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs.

CORPORATE CLIENTS Growing firms don’t (usually!) fail because they lack effort. They stall because clarity and capability don’t keep pace with growth. Resolute helps firms see what actually needs attention, align people and priorities, and develop leaders in ways that change how work gets done. We bring a clear-eyed, both/and perspective - human and business, strategy and execution - to deliver high-quality development that works at the level you need it, whether that’s one leader or the entire firm. The result is stronger leadership, better decisions, and growth that’s intentional instead of reactive. INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS Ambitious professionals don't need more advice - they need clarity, perspective, and a place to think honestly. Resolute works with capable leaders who are navigating bigger expectations, more complexity, and higher stakes, helping them separate the signal from the noise and move forward with both confidence and competence. As a trusted thinking partner, we bring structure, insight, and accountability - balancing challenge and support - to help leaders make better decisions, build real capability, and sustain momentum over time. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS Professional associations succeed when their leaders are prepared, aligned, and confident - and many volunteer leaders aren’t given the development they need to lead well. Resolute partners with associations to design and deliver professional development that respects volunteers’ time, intelligence, and real-world constraints while still creating meaningful growth. Our work is practical, human-centered, and rigorous, helping boards, committees, and cohort participants build the competencies and confidence needed to lead effectively and strengthen the organization as a whole.",

For over 17 years, I’ve partnered with CEOs, executive teams, and boards across venture capital, private equity, and Fortune 100 companies to align people strategies with business strategies, creating cultures that drive performance and innovation. As a C-suite Advisor on Talent, I specialize in helping leaders thrive amid uncertainty. My approach is rooted in understanding the complex interplay between people and organizations—designing strategies that not only meet immediate business needs but also foster long-term growth and resilience. I’ve had the privilege of consulting for global organizations, including Nike, Amazon, McKinsey, and Microsoft, as well as scaling startups, guiding them through inflection points that required deep leadership transformation and organizational redesign. Leadership, in my view, is not just about the individual; it’s about the intersection of culture, strategy, and human dynamics. By aligning human capital strategy with business objectives, organizations can navigate complexity and achieve sustainable success. I believe that trust, agility, and strategic talent development are essential for any organization looking to thrive in today’s rapidly changing landscape. As a reticulist, I bring together diverse, often unlikely, groups of people to create innovative solutions to today’s most pressing challenges. By convening different perspectives, I believe we can drive breakthroughs that push the boundaries of what’s possible—whether in business transformation, innovation, or addressing societal needs.

I hold a master’s degree in Organizational Development from Pepperdine University, where I’m an Adjunct Professor in the MBA program, teaching Talent Management. I’m also a member of Marshall Goldsmith’s 100 Coaches, a premier community of industry thought leaders curated and led by Marshall Goldsmith .

    "summary": "Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS.

I’ve spent years helping companies across banking, finance, healthcare, insurance, and retail adopt modern, agile ways of working, most often at the enterprise level. My work has spanned team-level change to large-scale transformations, helping organizations adopt frameworks like Scrum and Kanban and scale their practices using SAFe and variations of it. I became a 𝗖𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗺 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿® (𝗖𝗦𝗧) through Scrum Alliance, a designation held by a small number of people worldwide. I’m proud of this accomplishment because it reflects years of real-world experience applying Scrum where it truly fits. I offer public and private Scrum training for teams new to Scrum or that need a reset, because despite new frameworks and trends, Scrum is often still the 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 framework for the 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 teams, when taught well and applied intentionally. Enterprise work has been meaningful but also eye-opening. In big organizations, impact often happens in pockets. A few teams. A department. A pilot. Progress is real but slow, and it’s common to run into walls you can’t move, regardless of experience. That led me to a deliberate shift. I apply everything I’ve learned, what works, what doesn’t, and where organizations get stuck, and apply it to 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, including founders and solopreneurs. This is where decisions matter more, change happens faster, and the impact is immediate.

𝗦𝗠𝗕 & 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Helping companies grow revenue, streamline operations, clarify strategy, and align goals to execution. Less chaos. More focus. Forward momentum. 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: Delivering keynotes and workshops on accountability, ownership, intrinsic motivation, and intentional innovation. Perspective matters. I’ve seen what happens when strategy is disconnected from execution and how powerful it can be when leaders get clear, stay focused, and give teams both structure and agency. If you’re building, growing, or trying to move from reactive to intentional, I can help! Let's explore together!",

Because business touches every area of contemporary life from the latest products to essential services, and we can’t live without the benefits today’s companies provide. But we regularly read about corporations or even whole industries that seem to stumble from one ethics-related crisis to another. We see failures of leadership at once-trusted brands that cast doubt on pursuing business as a career. Can business be conducted in a way that benefits society, builds profitable and sustainable companies, and is consistent with Christian faith? At the Crowell School of Business our faculty believes that business may be one of the most impactful career choices available for lives of service today. Whether in a public or private company, for profit or non-profit, known brand or entrepreneurial start up, the knowledge and skills you gain at the Crowell School will be valuable for a lifetime of impact. Why are we uniquely positioned to provide this distinctive approach to business leadership? Because the Crowell School faculty along with the other five schools at Biola University take the integration of faith and knowledge seriously as it applies to business, theology, the arts and sciences, humanities and more. Few business schools work so intentionally to pull from various academic and spiritual disciplines to equip students for lives of significance and impact. At Crowell, business education is designed so you learn and put into practice career-relevant business skills while engaging your faith and launching your career. We invite you to learn more about our School and programs by following us on LinkedIn and going to our web page. Or even better: come by and visit us some time!",

My background and experience have uniquely prepared me to serve as a consultant and coach to prospective business owners considering an investment in a franchise system. My mission is to work with clients to winnow thousands of franchises down to a handful of good options, and ultimately the perfect business for them. I grew up in a series of small, family-run businesses – everything from a dry-cleaning shop to a liquor store to a meat market/deli/bakery. After getting a degree in marketing from Villanova University (and later an MBA from the Wharton School) I turned my attention to the corporate world working at Fortune 500 Companies like Procter & Gamble, Nabisco, and Kraft. Eventually, I became an entrepreneur importing ceramics from Italy and then spending almost 20 years running my own Executive Recruiting firm. I was even employed by a couple of franchisees along the way, flipping burgers at McDonald’s in college and working at one of the Midwest’s leading offices for Management Recruiters International. If I’ve learned anything along this journey it’s that running a business is NOT for everybody. Entrepreneurship is even tougher, taking long hours, expertise, commitment, and a high tolerance for risk. That said, business ownership can be incredibly fulfilling and offers many benefits in terms of work/life balance, financial rewards, and tax advantages. Best of all, being your own boss can be great. Really great. For many people, buying a franchise business can be the best way to become a business owner. You’re investing in an established system that’s already successful. You’re in business for yourself, but not by yourself. There are hundreds of options available allowing buyers to choose a business that capitalizes on their strengths and interests while accommodating their preferred working styles. Best of all, I know the GOOD franchises, can save you time and money, and there is no charge for my service. All my fees are paid from the marketing budgets of my franchise partners. If you’re serious about being in business, I can find one that will fit your needs.

After a 30+ year career in high-tech, comprised of both start-ups and enterprises, I founded the 20/20 Consulting Group to help leaders operate their organizations. Every organization runs on an invisible operating system => the flow of collaboration, influence, communication, knowledge, and trust that determines how fast work moves and how effectively strategy turns into results. By revealing this hidden system, leaders can see their Employee Relationship Capital: the collective value of employees, and their networks, who accelerate execution, broker trust across silos, and enable influence to flow through relationships that are invisible to org charts. Org design and work can be highly tuned and strategically adapted to fluid, ever-changing conditions. Scenario planning and critical employee decisions are supported by the following: => Which employees are the connectors and bridge builders? => Where does collaboration, communication and influence break down? => Which overly connected employees are at risk of burnout? => Who are the must retain employees? => Who are the sources of innovation and knowledge sharing? => Where do investments in people deliver the highest returns? By measuring how work and information flow, leaders are empowered to make informed decisions on the human side of performance and unlock faster execution and higher economic throughput from the organization they already have. Based in Broomfield, Colorado, I’m a father, coach, and advocate for veteran leadership in business.",

With 23 years in leadership development, organizational strategy, and executive coaching, I specialize in transforming reactive, high-pressure environments into aligned, scale-ready organizations. I bring a blend of strategic insight, operational discipline, and people-centered coaching that helps leaders navigate complexity, improve collaboration, and drive measurable performance. My work centers on partnering with CEOs as a strategic thought-partner, advisor, and operator who can translate vision into actionable steps and strengthen leadership effectiveness across the organization. What I’ve Done I have coached CEOs and senior leaders through strategic planning, operational alignment, and cross-functional execution. My recent 6-month engagement produced: • $300K–$500K in preventable mistakes avoided • $200K–$350K in annual revenue capacity unlocked • $150K+ in reclaimed leadership bandwidth These results came from installing a clear operating system, tightening decision rights, improving leadership rhythms, and removing structural drift, issues that quietly drain most growing organizations. I also delivered major customer and operational wins: • Increased lead-to-enrollment conversions to 40%+ • Reduced monthly churn to less than 3% • Achieved 95% SOP compliance across key functions • Stabilized multi-site operations during growth and leadership transition Across all engagements, I help CEOs think more strategically, communicate more clearly, and lead with greater confidence.

Then I realized – finding all three was like looking for a needle in a wheat field.So, I stopped looking and started reflecting. What I really love—the work that fires me up—is helping leaders and teams find their power and perform at their potential. Across my career, whether I was turning around a struggling nonprofit, helping to scale a cybersecurity firm, working on the Olympics, or running my own business, I kept seeing the same issue:➡️ Companies often put good people in leadership roles without the right training or support.➡️ Those leaders struggle, which leads to frustration, turnover, and wasted potential.➡️ The business suffers, and no one wins. But when companies get it right—when they develop strong leaders, put people in roles that fit their strengths, and create a culture where teams perform. That’s where the magic happens.How I Help Today, I partner with CEOs, founders, and leadership teams of mid-size companies to:🔹 Build better leaders – Who inspire, engage, and have the skills to lead.🔹 Put the right people in the right roles – When you play to their strengths, everyone wins.🔹 Create a culture that attracts & keeps top talent – No more revolving door of employees. I do this through leadership coaching, advisory, and fractional executive support, powered by data-driven tools like leadership diagnostics, psychometric assessments, and culture analytics. Leadership isn’t about titles—it’s about unlocking potential. When you get that right, performance, retention, and engagement follow naturally. Curious where to start?

You get a team that: • Owns outcomes instead of escalating issues • Stays steady under pressure • Brings solutions, not problems • Thinks with ownership and perspective Ownership isn’t a personality trait. It’s a skill—and it can be built. I spent 21 years in the U.S. Air Force, where self-leadership wasn’t optional—it was expected. When pressure hit, leaders were trusted to handle what belonged to them. After retiring, I saw the same truth play out everywhere: when leaders don’t lead themselves, someone above them has to. That’s why I built the I Lead Me framework—a practical approach that helps leaders manage pressure, make clear choices, and earn trust where it matters most.

The foundation’s name, “GIFT,” reflects our core mission: to help individuals Reflect God’s Image and Fulfill their Talent in service to others. By empowering mothers to heal and thrive, we aim to glorify God through purposeful living. How We Help: At the You Are a GIFT Foundation, we focus on partnering with local organizations and nonprofits to address the unique challenges mothers face on the journey to becoming addiction-free.

Our work is centered on offering a pathway for mothers to rebuild their lives, strengthen their families, and reclaim their purpose. Why We Exist: Prescription drug addiction often leaves mothers struggling to navigate the path to recovery alone. Our foundation exists to fill this gap by partnering with organizations to provide critical support, foster awareness, and pilot funding initiatives. Our ultimate goal is to empower mothers to overcome addiction, rebuild relationships with their families, and live meaningful, purpose-driven lives.",

    "summary": "What if you had a client acquisition system that consistently attracted, nurtured, and converted leads—without relying on referrals—allowing you to focus entirely on coaching? Many small businesses feel overwhelmed by marketing demands and constantly evolving strategies, distracting them from what matters most. The more you juggle client acquisition, marketing, and service, the closer you come to burnout. Relying solely on word of mouth is risky and limits growth. Without a solution, your dream of growing your business while maintaining a work-life balance becomes further out of reach. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many small businesses face the same challenge. You want to make a genuine impact, but the stress of marketing, nurturing clients, and running a business leaves little time for growth. What happens if you don’t solve this? ❌ You’ll keep spending more time chasing clients than servicing them. ❌ Financial instability will persist as you struggle to fill your pipeline. ❌ Burnout will creep in as you juggle marketing, client delivery & personal commitments. ❌ Your vision of becoming a thought leader will remain out of reach. Marketing is a full-time job, and you’re already dedicated to delivering on your own business. Without systems to streamline lead generation and nurture relationships, trying to do it all manually will continue to hold you back. At Chart Room Creative, we help small businesses attract, nurture, and convert clients—without burnout. We use proven marketing strategies to relieve your burden and build systems that help you scale your business and free your time for what you love—the work of your business. With over 25 years of experience in digital marketing, including being the director of global web and eCommerce at a Financial Times Top 10 organization, I’ve seen how smart marketing transforms organizations and how small businesses struggle with marketing and business growth.

They’re built by people who believe. And that’s where I come in. I don’t just build HR systems, I build belief. I’ve led culture transformations that have taken organizations from fractured to focused, from toxic to thriving, and from stagnant to scalable. My approach blends data-driven strategy with human-centered leadership because you can’t drive performance without first rebuilding trust. Throughout my career, I’ve been the leader called in to fix what’s broken and rebuild what’s possible. 🔹 At a Fortune 500 Company, I inherited the lowest-performing site in the nation — morale was low, turnover was high, and customer satisfaction was just 18%. Eighteen months later, we achieved 92% satisfaction and cut cycle times from 44 days to 18, outperforming the national average. 🔹 At a private sector company, I built HR infrastructure across eight business units, increasing retention by 35%, productivity by 25%, and reducing benefit costs by 15% — while maintaining 100% audit success. Those outcomes weren’t luck — they came from leadership grounded in three guiding principles: 1️⃣ Listen beyond the words — every voice matters. 2️⃣ Lead with strategy and heart — culture is both compass and engine. 3️⃣ Leave people better than you found them. I’m a People Watcher. A Culture Architect. A Hope Giver. I lead with compassion and excellence — helping executives align business strategy with human potential to drive engagement, retention, and measurable organizational performance. As your next Chief Human Resources Officer or People Culture Executive, I will: 👉 Transform culture into a measurable competitive advantage 👉 Build scalable systems that elevate growth, retention, and accountability 👉 Coach leaders to inspire, not just instruct 👉 Turn your workforce into a unified, purpose-driven community If you’re seeking a leader who can rebuild trust, re-energize teams, and deliver measurable results — let’s connect.

    "connections": "9401",
    "summary": "Most capable leaders don’t struggle because they lack skill. They struggle because the leadership game they’re winning no longer scales. At a certain point, what made you successful still works but it starts creating friction. - Execution slows. - Decisions pile up. - Effort increases, but impact doesn’t compound the way it used to. That moment is an inflection point. - Nothing is broken. - Performance is strong. - But the rules of the game have changed. Most leaders respond by working harder inside the old game. That usually makes things worse. 📍I work with capable leaders and executive teams at these inflection points when growth requires a different leadership game. My work focuses on helping leaders recognize: 🔸 when they’ve outgrown the game they’re playing 🔸 where their leadership model no longer fits the level of complexity 🔸 and how to update how they think, decide, and operate together so execution regains clarity, speed, and resilience This is not a performance problem. It’s not a motivation issue. It’s a leadership operating system mismatch. Where I Focus I work upstream of burnout, reorgs, and stalled execution, helping leaders shift from: • Expert leadership → system-level leadership Designing decision architecture instead of personally solving problems • Alignment by effort → alignment by design Reducing coordination friction and decision latency across teams and stakeholders • Heroic contribution → scalable impact Ensuring leadership effort converts into strategic outcomes, not exhaustion Background 20+ years of experience across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, working in complex, global environments where leadership scale and system design matter. Former global talent and organizational development leader in Fortune 500 contexts, with deep experience advising senior leaders navigating growth, complexity, and reinvention. That same discernment and discipline now underpin my work with leaders at inflection points. How We Work at Potentia My work begins with diagnosis and focuses on system-level change, not heroic effort. • Leadership Operating System Diagnostic Brief (entry point) • Leadership OS Intelligence Mapping (by invitation) • Reinvention OS Lab (system-level execution upgrade) You don’t need to simplify your environment.

Soon, we’re expanding with superpowHIM, because every young person deserves the tools to lead with character and courage.

I partner closely with executives, HR leaders, and managers to strengthen the everyday moments that define leadership: setting direction, giving feedback, navigating ambiguity, and supporting people through change. Through FutureForm, I work with leaders and teams to develop three timeless leadership capabilities: Clarity - Helping leaders focus on what matters most and communicate it so teams can move forward with confidence. Connection - Building trust, psychological safety, and real understanding between leaders and their teams. Confidence - Supporting leaders to lead with steadiness and authenticity, without relying on control. Career clarity is a core part of this work. When leaders and employees understand their strengths, values, and direction, performance improves, engagement deepens, and retention follows. Clarity at the individual level strengthens leadership at the organizational level.

Strategic Plans that Clarify What to Do Next Founded by Mason Scurry at 22, Scurry Consulting is not your average consulting firm. We’re not slow, corporate, or bloated. We’re fast, focused, and deeply invested in your success. Mason’s journey started early: – At 16, he co-founded a nonprofit and built a team of 120 volunteers in two weeks. – At 18, he accidentally launched a business that was acquired within two years. – At 21, he published his second book. And during his final semester at Brown University, he made the call to skip the safe path and build Scurry Consulting from scratch. No stability. No safety net. Just a commitment to help others build meaningful, profitable companies. Within four months: – 10 clients signed – 2 interns hired – $7,000/month in pre-commission revenue The systems that got him there are the same ones we now implement for clients. Our work is grounded in strategy, not fluff. We don’t sell shiny templates or one-size-fits-all solutions. We dig deep into how your business actually works, and then we help you design better ways to sell, serve, and scale. We work best with founders who are willing to think hard, work fast, and challenge their own assumptions. People who want clarity, not just clicks. People who want to move forward, not spin their wheels. If you’re that kind of founder, we’d love to work with you. Let’s build something that lasts.",

Where did she go, I wonder? Well, a COMPLETE burnout in HR during the pandemic and two, yes two, subsequent layoffs in two years, I'm finally free of the constraints our modern workplace norms have become. I would now describe myself as a former Human Resource professional who woke up one day and had enough of the games, the politicking, working the grind for someone else only to be a cog in the wheel. It became untenable. I was reminded that we really can only control the \"controllables\"... ... how we respond to change, the integrity with which we handle ourselves, how we manage our home & finances, how we take care of and love those who we love, and ultimately where/when/how we steward the gifts and time we've been given. Jobs will come and go but who you are in the in-between matters most. I recently read a famous quote that made my stomach turn and my pulse race ...\"The majority of people die at 35 but aren't buried until 75\" - I see what this represents all around me and have my whole career. People on autopilot, no self-reflecting, not thriving, not clear on their God-given purpose and direction. I believe God wants better for you and for me.

WHY MY EXPERIENCE MATTERS TO YOUR BUSINESS: I spent my career leading marketing, sales, and business development for well-known consumer brands and manufacturing firms. While my expertise began in consumer-driven industries, the principles of growth, positioning, and strategy apply universally and are just as critical for professional service firms as they are for consumer brands. Professional service firms struggle with differentiation, client acquisition, and scaling. Consumer brands focus on creating emotional connections, brand loyalty, and effective go-to-market strategies. My expertise blends both, helping professional service firms apply consumer-driven insights to win more business while guiding consumer brands to develop lasting market impact. HOW I HELP: ✔ Growth Strategy & Positioning – Establishing a compelling market position that drives demand and revenue. ✔ Leadership & Team Optimization – Helping owners develop leadership skills, structure strong teams, and build a results-driven culture. ✔ Sales & Marketing Acceleration – Driving lead generation, conversion, and long-term customer engagement. ✔ Business Efficiency & Financial Strategy – Identifying key operational efficiencies to improve profitability and scale effectively. ✔ Exit & Transition Planning – Preparing businesses for leadership transitions, mergers, or sales to maximize value. REAL RESULTS, REAL IMPACT: ✅ Transformed professional service firms by refining messaging, improving operations, and increasing client acquisition. ✅ Led go-to-market strategies that drove multimillion-dollar growth for national and global consumer brands. ✅ Revitalized declining industries through strategic branding and marketing that increased market share and profitability. ✅ Helped business owners scale and exit by positioning their companies for sustainable growth and maximum valuation.

I help leaders and organizations create a culture of inclusion and psychological safety where innovation thrives. My master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling informs my holistic, research-backed coaching framework. Together, we explore new perspectives and identify solutions for growth and success as well as health and well-being. In 1998, I moved from my native Finland to New York City. I was the first in my family to earn a college degree and, like many others, I craved the energy, inspiration, and diversity of life in NYC. I held career services and HR & development roles before founding my independent coaching practice. My expertise lies in international and highly-demanding professional contexts—since founding my practice, my work has taken me to Helsinki, Rome, Bangkok, and Bonn and I’ve worked with leaders based across six continents. Sisu—the Finnish concept of resilience—and my own personal experiences as an immigrant have deeply influenced my coaching philosophy. My approach to coaching is built upon a core belief in our human capacity to learn and grow, to succeed through challenges, and live and lead with purpose. Alongside my coaching practice, I am an experienced senior non-profit founder and board leader. I have founded, led, and developed several global and local non-profit community organizations over the past 30 years. After I moved to NYC, I founded two non-profit organizations with and for Nordic women. I have served as vice-president for a global non-profit FIGT.org, and the local Finnish American Chamber of Commerce in NYC. I led the Chatham High School Marching Band Club, a registered 501c3, as President for several years. As a leader, I am driven by my values to make a difference by strengthening communities through engagement. In all my leadership experiences, I have improved the performance and structure of the board—I am a skilled organizer known for getting things done. I lead with a strong vision and clear goals while building engagement and motivation through communication and relationship building.

    "summary": "Most organizations are drowning in tools they don't need, solving for problems they haven't defined. I help small businesses and nonprofits get aligned before AI, build structure before scale, and create systems that serve people—not the other way around. THE PROBLEM Leaders buy systems before documenting their sales process. They buy automation before clarifying workflow. They chase AI before knowing what problems they're solving. Result? Expensive technology that creates chaos, not clarity. The tech industry profits from this confusion. I don't. ALIGNED BEFORE AI I published a book by this title because I'm tired of watching businesses waste money on premature technology. CLARITY BEFORE COMPLEXITY – Before tools, we clarify what you're trying to accomplish. Until you can articulate this, no software will save you. STRUCTURE BEFORE SCALE – You cannot automate chaos. If processes are broken, AI breaks them faster. We build documented workflows first, then introduce technology. HUMANS BEFORE HYPE – AI amplifies what exists. Confused teams get more confused. Aligned teams become force multipliers. WHAT I'VE BUILT As Founder of Align & Innovate, I provide fractional Chief AI & Systems Officer services to organizations needing strategic technology leadership. Before that, I co-founded Visuals by Momo, helping 50+ nonprofits tell emotionally resonant stories through documentary productions. That taught me: the best technology means nothing if you can't tell a coherent story about what you do. I bring that lens to systems work. Every CRM, every workflow, every AI strategy—it's storytelling. I also host Visual Eyes Podcast, exploring storytelling, technology, and community impact. WHO I WORK WITH Leaders tired of tools that promise transformation but deliver headaches. Leaders ready to invest in foundational systems instead of chasing shiny objects. What I don't do: Sell software you don't need. Build AI that impresses investors but confuses teams. What I do: Ask hard questions. Design systems that reduce friction. Train teams to own tools—not be owned by them. MY CREDENTIALS • AI+ Chief AI Officer Certified • Board of Directors, HandsOn South Florida • Author: \"Aligned Before AI\" (Amazon, 2025) • Co-Founder, Visuals by Momo I don't sell what you don't need.

The World Bank estimates that 40 percent of the global population lives in places of high vulnerability to climate change. \"Business as usual\" investing could put asset owners at risk of not meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, being misaligned with rapidly evolving regulations/guidelines or simply being out of touch with their stakeholders’ sustainability convictions. I am the professional you can partner with and trust on your transition from the Institutional Investor you are to the Responsible Institutional Investor you aim to become. 1-Expertise and Experience: I am a qualified actuary (FCIA, FSA) and Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) with expertise in pension plan governance, funding, investing, ESG integration and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. I have 30 years of experience with global consulting firms, portfolio managers and plan sponsors. 2-Integrity and trustworthiness: As a member of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) I adhere to strict Standards and Rules of Professional Conduct. I received the 2022 CIA President’s Award for my groundbreaking work as Chair of the Climate Change and Sustainability Committee serving the Institute’s 6,000 members. My clients value my honest communication, my creative thinking, and my rigorous analysis. I make my clients feel heard and respected. 3- Availability and affordability: You will have direct access to my in-depth knowledge of the Institutional Investment market to solve your Responsible Investment problems and challenges. I plan to manage my client load to maintain a high level of quality. My fees are affordable in comparison to large consulting firms. The following are some of the services I offer: • Education sessions for Board, management, or members • Diagnostic assessment with gap analysis vs. peers, regulations and best practice • Governance structure review • Workshop facilitation and action plan creation • Responsible Investment (RI) policy review/formulation and implementation • Climate Strategy development and implementation NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP in 2025 WITH SAI Inc.

    "summary": "Hi, I’m Carlamay Sheremata. I’m a retired police officer, keynote speaker, award-winning author, and family conflict resolution specialist—but more than that, I’m a bridge-builder. Between systems and people. Between leaders and their teams. Between families and the youth they love. After 21 years in law enforcement—including 8.5 years as a School Resource Officer—I’ve seen what happens when people lose connection. I’ve watched families fracture, leaders burn out, teams implode, and kids fall through the cracks. Not because people didn’t care—but because they didn’t know how to lead through the hard stuff. That’s why I created the CALM Leadership Method™—a trust-centered, emotionally intelligent approach to leadership that works in real life. Under pressure. In crisis. In the moments that matter most. I now help corporate teams, educators, frontline professionals, and families lead with connection, rebuild trust where it’s been lost, and communicate clearly when it counts most—at home, at work, and everywhere in between. Whether I’m on stage speaking to executives, equipping frontline teams, or sitting across from a family in conflict, I bring the same message: Connection heals what correction can’t. And if we don’t fix the disconnection, we lose the people who need us most. I’m also the author of the award-winning book Youth Truth: Engaging in Conversations That Can Change Lives—a raw, practical guide that equips parents, educators, and mentors to connect with today’s youth on the tough topics that matter most. It’s not just a book—it’s a bridge between generations, emotions, and relationships. Through real stories, bold truths, and actionable tools, I teach people how to lead with clarity, courage, and compassion—without burning out or checking out. Because when we get connection right, everything changes.

    "summary": "Con más de 24 años liderando estrategias de marca, comunicación y relaciones públicas —principalmente en el sector financiero— he vivido en carne propia las brechas, silencios y techos que enfrentan las mujeres en el mundo corporativo. Por eso fundé Estimada Rebel, no como un proyecto más, sino como un movimiento para rediseñar el lugar que ocupamos las mujeres en las empresas: con poder, propósito y autonomía. Hoy, como CEO de Estimada Rebel, diseño e implemento programas de alto impacto como Confident Rebel y Rebel Leader, además de asesorar a organizaciones que buscan transformar sus culturas hacia un liderazgo más inclusivo. A través de nuestro enfoque estratégico, miles de mujeres han fortalecido su confianza, aprendido a comunicar su valor y avanzado hacia puestos de liderazgo con visión, ambición y sin culpa. Mi carrera comenzó mucho antes de emprender. He liderado equipos en GBM, la institución financiera independiente más grande de México, RIU Hotels & Resorts y el British Council, enfrentando de cerca los desafíos de crecer profesionalmente en estructuras donde las decisiones se toman —aún hoy— sin mujeres en la mesa. Esa experiencia no solo afiló mi mirada estratégica, sino que encendió mi convicción: no basta con abrir espacio, hay que preparar a más mujeres para ocuparlo con claridad, autoridad y resultados. Mi formación como Business Coach certificada por Newfield Consulting, bajo la metodología de Rafael Echeverría, y mi especialización en Liderazgo Femenino por Harvard Business School, respaldan una propuesta que integra desarrollo personal, confianza profesional y visión de negocio. Lo que ofrecemos en Estimada Rebel no es inspiración vacía: es estrategia aplicada para mujeres decididas a liderar. Creo firmemente que el talento femenino está listo para ocupar el centro de la conversación empresarial. Mi misión es asegurar que también esté listo para liderarla.",

    "summary": "I’ve spent my entire career inside HR. But the people I care about most aren’t sitting in corporate boardrooms. They’re running skilled trades and service businesses. They’re out in the field early, managing crews, juggling schedules, solving problems in real time — and doing everything they can to keep the work moving and their people supported. And almost every one of them has said some version of the same thing to me: “I know HR matters… I just don’t have the time. And honestly, I’m not even sure where to start.” That’s exactly why I founded On Demand HR Solutions. Small, growing trades businesses don’t need corporate HR theory or overbuilt policies that don’t fit how the work actually gets done. They need simple, practical HR support — delivered in a way that works alongside the business, not on top of it. That’s where I come in. I work as an independent on-demand HR partner for skilled trades businesses, and I offer a few clear ways to get support, depending on what you need right now: HR SOS Session A focused, one-hour working session to tackle one specific HR issue — a people problem, compliance question, hiring concern, or “this just came up and I need help” situation. HR Blueprint A short-term, hands-on engagement to put the HR foundations in place — clear policies, better hiring and onboarding, and simple systems that bring structure and consistency to how you manage your crew. HR Advisory Ongoing HR support for owners who want a trusted partner in their corner — someone they can call, message, or loop in when questions come up, decisions need to be made, or issues start to surface. No over-engineered solutions. No corporate speak. No judgment. Just honest, practical HR support designed for businesses where the work happens in the field. I believe HR should make running a business easier — not harder. If you’re not sure which option makes sense, that’s okay. Most people aren’t. Send me a message here on LinkedIn and tell me what’s going on. I’ll help you figure out the simplest next step. 📥 Message me on LinkedIn — I’m just one DM away.",

    "job_description": "After more than 30 years leading HR in complex corporate environments, I started noticing a pattern. Small, growing skilled trades businesses were being asked to manage the same HR responsibilities: hiring, onboarding, safety, compliance, employee issues — without the time, support, or internal HR teams that larger companies rely on. Most owners don't want to “do HR.” They just wanted the work to run smoothly, their crews supported, and their business protected. So I founded On Demand HR Solutions to meet them where they are. Today, I work as an on-demand HR partner for skilled trades and field-based businesses, helping owners put practical HR systems in place that actually work in real life. My focus is HR operations and people management that supports how trades businesses run day to day. That includes everything from hiring and onboarding crews, to setting clear expectations, handling employee issues, and staying compliant as the business grows. I step in where HR usually falls through the cracks and help bring structure, clarity, and consistency without overcomplicating things. What this looks like in practice: - Acting as the HR department for small trades businesses, providing on-demand guidance, HR administration, and compliance support - Supporting owners through sensitive employee relations issues with a balance of compassion, clarity, and compliance - Building right-sized HR foundations — handbooks, policies, onboarding processes, and basic systems that crews can actually follow - Providing fractional or interim HR support when a business needs experienced HR leadership without hiring full-time - Helping owners move from reactive, day-to-day people issues to more stable, repeatable ways of managing their teams This work allows me to do what I care about most: Making HR feel manageable for business owners who already have enough on their plates — and helping trades businesses grow without the constant stress of “figuring it out as they go.”",

    "previous_job_description": "While my title at Integra LifeSciences changed over 16 years, the constant was transformation. Integra’s growth-by-acquisition strategy meant the business—and HR—were always evolving. Every acquisition brought new people, systems, and challenges, giving me the opportunity to reinvent HR over and over again. It often felt like working for a dozen companies within one. In my final role as Head of Global HR Service Delivery, I built and led what became the one-stop-shop for employee support across payroll, benefits, onboarding, leave of absence, employee relations and more. I launched ServiceNow globally, to streamline employee inquiries, reducing response times to under 24 hours, and creating a single source of truth for HR processes. This work supported a dynamic, fast-scaling organization where clear, efficient HR processes were critical. But beyond the systems and processes, what I’m most proud of is how we made HR approachable again—turning a fragmented, confusing experience into one where employees felt supported and leaders had the tools they needed to lead confidently. Earlier, as Head of HR for Corporate Functions, I served as the executive HR partner to C-Suite Finance, IT, Legal, Business Development, and Scientific leaders—supporting them through organization design, restructuring, and workforce planning. I helped leaders build talent strategies, navigate organizational changes, and integrate acquired teams seamlessly into the business. As HR Manager, I supported global operations, quality, regulatory, and commercial sales teams, leading recruitment and retention strategies, launching training programs, and guiding leaders through performance management and employee relations issues. Integra was where I learned to thrive in ambiguity, manage change without losing sight of people, and ensure HR always aligned with the evolving needs of the business.",
