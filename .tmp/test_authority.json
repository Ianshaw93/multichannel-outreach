    "summary": "I work with smart, ambitious professionals and the organizations they lead — helping teams and leaders get unstuck, aligned, and ready to move when things feel complex or high-stakes. I’ve always been drawn to the moments when we're stretched — new roles, big decisions, career pivots, team resets. That’s where we grow - but also where we can be most in need of support. Before founding Resolute Consulting, I had a first career in adult education and a second in professional services leadership. I’ve taught in classrooms, led strategic initiatives inside AEC firms, and advised professionals through key transitions. That dual lens (how people learn and how businesses function) grounds my approach. I combine strategy, learning design, and deeply human facilitation to move clients from good ideas to real outcomes. Today, I partner primarily with organizations to design programs and facilitate engagement that builds confidence and competence, capacity and connection. I also provide leadership advisory and retainer-based support for firms navigating growth, change, or recalibration. Engagements may include: • Retreats with teeth — and follow-through • Strategic planning and leadership offsites • Advisory support for firm leaders and teams • Leadership development cohorts with real-world relevance • Workshop series that respect your time and get results • Association and conference programming that blends substance with engagement Clients often say I bring both structure and empathy. I make things clearer, calmer, and more doable, while challenging teams to think and act with purpose. I’ve led hundreds of sessions across industries and know how to meet a group where they are and move them forward. While I offer coaching for a select number of individuals, most of my work happens inside organizations aligning business goals with human needs. If you’re developing your leadership pipeline, planning a retreat, navigating change, or looking for a strategic facilitator and advisor — let’s talk. 📍 Based in DC, available nationwide 🔗 www.resoluteconsulting.co | joanna@resoluteconsulting.co | 301 873 9481",

I partner with organizations to navigate complexity, align teams, and drive strategic growth. Leveraging a dual background in adult education and professional services leadership, I design and deliver programming that builds capacity, fosters connection, and delivers actionable outcomes. I do this through: • Learning & Development: Researching, writing, and delivering adult learning programs focused on emotional intelligence, communication skills, and strengths-based leadership. Building the non-technical skills for technical experts. • Strategic Advisory: Providing thought partnership for leaders, particularly those with technical-based career paths. • Program Design & Facilitation: Crafting and leading retreats, leadership development cohorts, and workshop series tailored to client needs. • Academic teaching and advising: Adjunct Professor and Faculty for curriculum grounded in career readiness. My sector expertise includes AEC, CRE, professional services firms, and associations. Through my role at Resolute, I have: • Facilitated over 100 learning sessions across various industries, consistently receiving high client satisfaction ratings. • Implemented leadership development programs resulting in measurable improvements in team performance and engagement. • Advised executive teams during organizational transitions, contributing to successful change management initiatives.

    "connections": "3456",
    "summary": "Leadership wasn’t built for a people-first focus. It’s time to re-engineer it. I help executives and organizations transform empathy from being seen as a “soft skill” into a strategic leadership advantage. Using my ROE (Return on Empathy) framework, I turn Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) into Key People Indicators – strengthening trust, accelerating decision-making, and improving business outcomes. The truth is, organizations rarely fail for lack of strategy; they struggle because people don’t feel safe, seen, or supported. Most leaders default to ME-pathy (“understand me, my intent, my stress”) without realizing it. True EM-pathy (“let me understand you first”) drives psychological safety, retention, engagement, and innovation. My Mission To prove, with data and lived experience, that ROE is the new ROI. My Journey & Expertise I began life with a lesson in belonging -- adopted at three weeks old by parents who taught me worthiness, compassion, and unconditional love. Then came male-saturated industries where those traits weren’t always valued. I watched brilliant people burn out, values get compromised, and leaders rewarded for bureaucracy over bravery. I led that way once, too … until it backfired. My breakdown became my breakthrough. What I Offer EQ Assessment + Debrief A science-backed evaluation of baseline emotional intelligence across four key areas-Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness & Relationship Management culminating in a personalized EQ Call to ACTion that becomes each leader’s roadmap for growth. Culture Consulting (ROE Framework) My signature Return on Empathy (ROE) methodology transforms organizational culture by shifting leaders from ME-pathy to EM-pathy, strengthening psychological safety, trust and communication across all levels within your organization. Keynotes That Create a Bias for Action Dynamic, evidenced-base talks on EQ, empathy, psychological safety and trust—showing leaders how to make People FIRST = Performance ALWAYS. Track Record - Creator of the ROE (Return on Empathy) model and International Best Selling Author - Global keynote speaker on empathy, EQ psychological safety (U.S., Africa, Europe, SE Asia) - 25+ years leading teams in engineering, construction & high-risk government projects - Leading organizations from accidental to intentional cultures, rooted in their values and aligned with their vision. - Sparring partner for leaders across STEM, Operations and Federal Government Ready to turn empathy into your next strategic advantage?
