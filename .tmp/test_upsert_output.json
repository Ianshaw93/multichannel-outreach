    "summary": "I don’t start with retainers. I start with results. If your pipeline is stalling, your sales cycles are dragging, or your “growth plan” still relies on the founder’s Rolodex, the problem isn’t your team. It’s your system. Or lack of one. Most early-stage tech companies hit a plateau because they confuse motion with momentum. - They generate leads... but not sales conversations. - They hire reps... before fixing the funnel. - They enter the US market... with messaging that doesn’t land. Here’s what most teams miss: “You cannot succeed in your market without an intimate understanding of your ICP and why they’ll write you a check.” To catch the right fish, you need to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right bait. I teach you how. I’ve worked with over 50+ B2B SaaS and tech-enabled service companies, especially those in healthcare, financial services, and other regulated markets — to help them: - Multiply pipeline by 2–3× - Cut sales cycles in half - Reduce CAC by 30–50% - Build outbound systems that actually generate sales conversations - Create repeatable sales processes that don’t rely on heroics And I do it in a phased, capital-efficient way: Step 1 — ICP Sprint: Define and validate your highest-fit buyer segments, key decision makers, and messaging that resonates. Step 2 — Outreach Engine Build: Stand up a multichannel system (LinkedIn + email + content) that generates real conversations in less than 90 days. Step 3 — Revenue Ops Process: Establish a repeatable sales process, CRM, reporting, and enablement to convert conversations into revenue. Step 4 — Advisory: Once traction is proven, I step in to drive strategy, coach the team, and scale execution. 📥 Want to see how this plays out in the real world?

I help leaders and organizations create a culture of inclusion and psychological safety where innovation thrives. My master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling informs my holistic, research-backed coaching framework. Together, we explore new perspectives and identify solutions for growth and success as well as health and well-being. In 1998, I moved from my native Finland to New York City. I was the first in my family to earn a college degree and, like many others, I craved the energy, inspiration, and diversity of life in NYC. I held career services and HR & development roles before founding my independent coaching practice. My expertise lies in international and highly-demanding professional contexts—since founding my practice, my work has taken me to Helsinki, Rome, Bangkok, and Bonn and I’ve worked with leaders based across six continents. Sisu—the Finnish concept of resilience—and my own personal experiences as an immigrant have deeply influenced my coaching philosophy. My approach to coaching is built upon a core belief in our human capacity to learn and grow, to succeed through challenges, and live and lead with purpose. Alongside my coaching practice, I am an experienced senior non-profit founder and board leader. I have founded, led, and developed several global and local non-profit community organizations over the past 30 years. After I moved to NYC, I founded two non-profit organizations with and for Nordic women. I have served as vice-president for a global non-profit FIGT.org, and the local Finnish American Chamber of Commerce in NYC. I led the Chatham High School Marching Band Club, a registered 501c3, as President for several years. As a leader, I am driven by my values to make a difference by strengthening communities through engagement. In all my leadership experiences, I have improved the performance and structure of the board—I am a skilled organizer known for getting things done.
