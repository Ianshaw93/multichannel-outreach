    "about": "Most SaaS companies lose more revenue through the back door than they bring in the front. Having audited $500M in assets and managed complex energy-tech implementations, I\u2019ve found that growth is a retention and operations challenge. I specialize in identifying revenue leaks where messy handovers and slow product adoption stall company momentum.\n\nI audit the entire customer lifecycle. By asking the right questions where is the friction in onboarding? Why is the time-to-value lagging? I uncover the blockers to Net Revenue Retention (NRR). Whether at KPMG or ReviveBattery B.V., I lead with a discovery-first mindset to ensure every move is backed by data and aligned with the customer\u2019s business goals.\n\nMy response to churn is a bias for action. I build the frameworks that turn new sign-ups into long-term advocates. My track record includes:\n\nDriving Adoption: Increased monthly engagement by 20%+ through structured onboarding workflows.\n\nOperational Excellence: Designed SOPs and Sales-to-Success handovers that eliminate friction and ensure total visibility.\n\nCRM Mastery: Optimizing HubSpot and Salesforce to ensure data accuracy and pipeline health.\n\nGlobal Impact: Leading enterprise success for remote-first teams across the US, UK, and Australian markets.\n\n I translate activities into clear business outcomes. Through data-driven QBRs and ROI tracking, I articulate the value of the platform to stakeholders from founders to the C-suite. My goal is simple: to build the structure that drives 90%+ renewals and transforms Customer Success into a predictable revenue engine.",

    "about": "I help companies make better decisions when the stakes are high.\nMost of my work sits at the intersection of business, data, and execution.\n\nI take messy, fragmented information and turn it into clear, defensible insights that leadership can actually use. Not just dashboards that look good, but analysis that answers real questions about cost, risk, performance, and opportunity.\n\nI have worked on multi million dollar construction projects supporting owners and executives in subcontractor selection, bid analysis, and scope evaluation. I have also built analytics solutions for marketing, sales, and logistics teams, helping them understand what is driving revenue, costs, delays, and operational inefficiencies.\n\nMy approach is hands on and end to end. I handle data extraction, cleaning, modeling, and automation using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. From there, I design executive ready dashboards and KPI frameworks that replace intuition with clarity and speed.\n\nI am not interested in reporting for the sake of reporting. I focus on questions like which option is truly the most cost effective, where risk is being underestimated, what is driving performance, and how decisions today will impact results tomorrow.\n\nIf you are looking for someone who can bridge data, finance, and operations and turn complexity into clear business direction, we will work well together.",

It was an inspiring day filled with incredible startup pitches, and panel discussions focusing on the future of sustainability, and AI innovation.\n\nOne of the standout moments for me was the sustainability panel, where Supriya Sharma made an important observation:\n\"VCs need to exercise a more patient cycle when it comes to sustainability and climate tech startups.\"\n\nAs someone who deeply cares about building a sustainable future, this struck me as a critical insight. Sustainability is the defining challenge of our time! Startups innovating in this space need more than funding; they need patient capital and long-term vision from investors. I believe the future of our planet depends on bold collaboration between founders, VCs, and policymakers.\n\nA huge thank you to mridula goel and the organizing team for curating such a meaningful event. It\u2019s always a pleasure to engage with BITS Pilani community.\n\n\n\n\n#Sustainability #ClimateTech #Innovation #BITSian #FutureOfAI #Startups",
