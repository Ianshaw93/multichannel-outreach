I noticed your laser focus on early-stage DeepTech hardware startups - it's refreshing to see an investor with such clear investment criteria and values-driven approach.

Quick question: What's the biggest gap you're seeing between what DeepTech hardware founders think investors want versus what you actually look for when evaluating these startups?

Love that you're championing American innovation and keeping the focus on domestic tech development. The US needs more investors willing to take a strong stance on supporting homegrown deep tech.

I noticed your unique approach combining podcast production with strategic partnerships at Peoplebound - it's fascinating how you're using live video interview formats to help B2B companies build deeper client relationships. That's such a smart way to leverage content for relationship-building rather than just lead generation.

With your three decades in communication and SaaS sales, I'm curious: what's the biggest shift you've seen in how B2B companies approach client engagement through content, especially post-pandemic?

Your volunteer work with Humanity's Team also caught my attention - it speaks to the values-driven approach that seems to guide your business philosophy.

Tucson must be a great base for your work - I imagine the entrepreneurial community there really values authentic, relationship-focused approaches like yours.

I noticed you've carved out a really specific niche helping manufacturers, banks, and service professionals with their sales processes - that's smart positioning in such a crowded coaching space.

I'm curious: what's the most common disconnect you see between the meetings salespeople are getting and the deals they're actually closing? I imagine there's often a gap between activity and quality outcomes.

Your focus on helping businesses grow faster really resonates, especially in today's competitive landscape where every meeting needs to count.

The Greater Boston area has such a strong mix of established manufacturers and innovative service companies - must give you great variety in the challenges you help solve.

I noticed you've built quite a specialized niche helping companies grow through strategic sales talent acquisition - that's such a critical piece that many businesses overlook when scaling.

I'm curious: when you're working with companies in the Greater Boston area, what's typically the biggest blind spot you see leaders have when it comes to identifying top sales talent versus just good salespeople?

Boston's such a competitive market for talent acquisition, especially with all the tech and biotech growth happening there. You must have some fascinating insights from being right in the thick of it!

I noticed you specialize in helping leaders transition from being stuck in the day-to-day firefighting to actually working ON their business rather than IN it - that's such a critical shift most entrepreneurs struggle with.

Your focus on breaking down silos and driving real accountability resonates with me. I'm curious: what's typically the biggest ""aha moment"" you see when leaders finally step back from micromanaging and start empowering their teams to own outcomes?

It seems like you've built something really impactful with Leader's Edge. The Pacific Northwest has such a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem - Puyallup must give you great access to both the Seattle business scene and those growing companies throughout the region.

Would love to connect and learn more about your approach to leadership development.
