Hey {firstName},

Thanks for connecting!

I noticed {companyName} is growing fast. We've helped similar companies book 40% more qualified meetings by orchestrating LinkedIn + email + phone outreach.

Quick question: Are you currently using any automation for your outbound, or is it mostly manual?

Happy to share what's working for companies in your space.

Best,
[Your Name]

NOTES:
- This is a follow-up message after connection is accepted
- Set this up in HeyReach UI as step 2 in your sequence
- Can use same custom variables as connection request
- Add delays (3-5 days after acceptance) in HeyReach settings
